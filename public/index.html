<p>Welcome! I am an Assistant Professor in the <a href="https://www.clemson.edu/caah/departments/history/">Department of History and Geography</a> at Clemson University. I specialize in digital history as well as late-nineteenth and twentieth-century U.S. history with a focus on women and gender.</p>
<p>Previously, I was a Digital Humanities Postdoctoral Fellow at Southern Methodist University&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.smu.edu/cph">Center for Presidential History.</a>I earned my Ph.D. from George Mason University in 2019. From 2013 to 2015 I was a Digital History Fellow at the <a href="https://rrchnm.org">Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and New Media (RRCHNM)</a>. Following my fellowship, I continued at RRCHNM where I served as the Software Development Manager for the <a href="https://pressforward.org">PressForward Project</a> and as the Managing Editor of <a href="https://digitalhumanitiesnow.org">Digital Humanities Now</a>.</p>
<p>I am currently working on a book manuscript entitled, [<em>Shaping Up: Physical Fitness for Women 1880-1965</em>, which examines why the fitness of female bodies was a matter of national concern and interest throughout the twentieth century.</p>
<p>I am also the co-director of <a href="http://www.mappingthegayguides.org">Mapping the Gay Guides</a>, an NEH funded digital mapping project that draws on Bob Damron’s Address Books, a prolific set of travel guides that became almost survival guides to gay and queer travelers across the United States in the last three decades of the twentieth century. Much like the Green Books of the 1950s and 1960s, which African Americans used to find friendly businesses that would cater to black citizens in the era of Jim Crow apartheid, Damron’s guidebooks aided a generation of queer people in identifying sites of community, pleasure, and politics.Our research team has begun turning the thousands of listings within the guides into usable, functioning data to allow researchers to make connections between historical queer communities.</p>
<p>You can view my <a href="/projects">digital projects here</a> or view my code on <a href="http://www.github.com/regan008">GitHub</a>. I can be reached by email at aeregan (at) clemson.edu and I tweet at <a href="http://www.twitter.com/regan008">@regan008</a>.</p>
