      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;course-overview&#34;&gt;Course Overview&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Welcome to History 8500, Methods in Digital History I. This course in computational history will teach you to create, manipulate, explore, and visualize historical data with the goal of advancing historical arguments.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This course will proceed in roughly 3 units. In the first students will learn to navigate their computer using the command line, learn file system structure and basic server architecture, and will learn how to use GitHub to ensure reproducible datasets and code. Students will also be introduced to static websites and will begin a semester long project of building a personal website and portfolio in the static website software Hugo. The next unit focuses on the basics of the programming with an emphasis on computational thinking skills and the foundational patterns behind every programming language. Finally, in the last half of our course, we will survey various methods within computational history and ask ourselves, what kinds of historical questions do these methods make possible? Each week will focus on a new method &amp;ndash; visualization, mapping, and several forms of text analysis. By the end of this course, you&amp;rsquo;ll have gained a basic familiarity and competency all of these approaches, but &lt;strong&gt;more importantly&lt;/strong&gt; you&amp;rsquo;ll understand how to ask and answer historical questions using the computational methods that are useful to you. While not required, it is best to take this course alongside History 8550: Theories of Digital Analysis which has been designed to complement the topics in this class and provide a theoretical and scholarly underpinning for the methods we learn in class.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This course surveys the history of the United States, beginning with the end of the Civil War  and ending in the modern day. By the end of this course, students will have obtained a solid understanding of the major events and forces in American history. Throughout the course we will pay close attention to the major political, social, and economic movements of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Additionally we will disrupt the traditional narrative of American history by focusing on the many &lt;em&gt;histories&lt;/em&gt; of the United States. Relying heavily on both textual and visual primary sources, we will spend this semester looking at the major events in U.S. history not as points in a singular and linear narrative but rather a series of interwoven stories driven by a diverse set of actors.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;course-description&#34;&gt;Course Description&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Welcome to History 8510, Methods in Digital History II. This course in computational history will teach you to create, manipulate, explore, and visualize historical data with the goal of advancing historical arguments.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This class is the second in a series of digital history courses at Clemson University. It is designed to build on History 8500: Digital Methods I. In that course you reviewed digital history projects and methods, experimented with out of the box tools, and developed your own digital research collections. In this course we will build on that and you will now learn to use computational methods to analyze historical sources in the programming language R.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you are in a Ph.D. program, you are training to be a professional historian. As part of that training you will build a base of knowledge and familiarity with key works of historical scholarship in your field. Its a good idea to develop a system early in your career for taking notes and keeping track of everything you&amp;rsquo;ve read. You never know when you&amp;rsquo;ll need to come back to a book.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;course-overview&#34;&gt;Course Overview&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;History 8550 is a seminar in digital history where students will create a piece of digital scholarship that uses digital history methods to advance a historical argument. Students will work in collaboration with the course instructor and their primary advisor to come up with a project that uses digital methods to advance a historiographical interpretation. Unlike a traditional seminar paper, this paper will likely have multiple components (a dataset, narrative writing piece, and code).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/resources/annotated-syllabi-guidelines/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Students in the Digital History Ph.D. program at Clemson University prepare comprehensive portfolios in lieu of a traditional comprehensive exam. A component of that portfolio includes annotated syllabi for each of the three fields. The exact topics and breakdown of those 3 syllabi should be discussed with your advisory committee during your Portfolio Plan meeting which typically is filled out the semester before you prepare and defend your portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Please note that these are Dr. Regan’s guidelines for annotated syllabi. If you are not preparing a portfolio for Dr. Regan you should check with your advisory committee about standards and guidelines for the annotated syllabi.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Congrats! You&amp;rsquo;ve survived History 8510 and are now a Programming Historian!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://giphy.com/embed/BlrTLd1ml3A52&#34; width=&#34;480&#34; height=&#34;240&#34; frameBorder=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;giphy-embed&#34; allowFullScreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You now know how to code. As you look forward to future digital projects, assignments, and classes remember that part of knowing how to code means that you also know how to read code. This semester you learned a lot of syntax and patterns, but you also learned how to learn to learn to do things. Going forward, build on this. See something you find interesting? Dig into the code to see how they did it. Teach yourself. Ask for help where needed and rely on your cohort and classmates. And&amp;hellip;if all else fails&amp;hellip;turn it off and back on again!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Includes Honors sections.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In this course we will explore American history beginning with the initial settlement of the continent and ending with the Civil War. Rather than covering every detail and event within this period, the course will focus on providing a broad overview of how the United States came to be, the major forces shaping its development, and the significance of Colonial America. Students will leave this class with a basic understanding of the major turning points and events in American History to 1865 and will study how political, economic, social, intellectual, cultural, and religious changes shaped the development of the early United States.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Shaping Up: Physical Fitness Initatives for Women, 1880-1965</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/projects/shapingup/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 31 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/projects/shapingup/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Beginning in 1880 and ending during the Cold War, &lt;em&gt;Shaping Up&lt;/em&gt; examines why the fitness of female bodies was a matter of national concern and interest. It argues that the shape of the female body and the discourses surrounding it were frequently correlated with larger social, political and economic issues. While the definition of being “in shape” or acquiring “shapeliness” changed numerous times between 1880 and 1965, the patriarchal focus on developing fit female bodies remained a constant and served various economic, social, and political purposes. Whether spurred by fears about the increasing levels of  undesirable or “unfit” immigrants and their potential effect on the Anglo-Saxon race; a concern about mixed sex amusements in the modern city and the “excess energy” that drove working women to seek out such amusements; or the economic necessity of women’s participation in war work, which required fitness, but threatened gender hierarchies and the appeal of the female body for the male gaze, fitness was a tool in the repertoire of physical educators, reformers, and state actors who sought to shape behavior and inscribe their values onto the female body in reaction to social anxieties. Each chapter explores a moment when the fitness of the female body became an issue of national concern.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

An LGBT equivalent to the African American “green books,” the Damron guides contained lists of bars, bathhouses, cinemas, hotels, advocacy organizations and cruising sites in every U.S. state. MGG seeks to associate geographical coordinates with each location mentioned within the Damron Guides and provide an interface for visualizing and stuyding the growth in LGBTQ sites between 1965 and 2005. Made up of a public-facing and freely available web app as well as a series of digital vignettes that analyze the data using historical context, MGG stands to make a significant contribution to scholars understanding of the ways in which LGBTQ people negotiated and appropriated public space to form community.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Using the PressForward plugin and relying on a community of volunteer editors, &lt;em&gt;DHNow&lt;/em&gt; has sought to encourage scholars to share their research and learned expertise on the open web. DHNow had developed methodologies and technologies to facilitate the aggregation and curation of gray literature-scholarly work (white papers, presentations, research reports, essays etc.) that may not otherwise have a formal venue for publication.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The columns, authored six days a week until January 1961 and then three days a week thereafter, represent the only consistent account of her public activities. Thanks to the work of the Eleanor Roosevelt Papers’ staff, who transcribed each My Day column and made them available online, anyone with internet access can now explore this important piece of history.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

First, as the Graduate Research Assistant, and later the Software Development Manager, I collaborated with team members to outline development priorities and milestone goals while also overseeing the testing and release processes. I also built the &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;PressForward TurnKey Theme&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; which allows publications to make PressForward statistics easily viewable by readers. In 2017 I undertook redesigning the PressFoward.org website.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

We designed an information architecture that would capture the data contained on the coversheet of grant applications and we each input documents related to one of the center&amp;rsquo;s major projects. The item metadata is designed in a way that is meant to be flexible and allow researchers to use the API to ask and answer questions about the history of RRCHNM.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

For the event, George Washington University, the Library of Congress and the Smithsonian provided participants with a series of datasets. The corpus that we gravitated toward included all of Eleanor Roosevelt&amp;rsquo;s &lt;strong&gt;My Day&lt;/strong&gt; columns. During the workshop, we ran a 60 topic model on the columns. Due to time constraints and technical challenges during the workshop we were not able to accomplish much beyond creating the topics. The dataset, composed of almost 8,000 columns, resulted in large files that required manipulation with a tool such as R in order to create visualizations and analyze the results. This made it  difficult for participants to do much with the topic modeling results during the workshop. Over the last two weeks, we have worked to take the topic model, manipulate the results, and create an interactive app with several visualizations that allows for an exploration of the topic model. This blog post will detail some of the process of making this visualization and describe how it might be used and interpreted.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

In this class students explore technologies such as maps, data sets, and visualizations within the context of an upper division history class. Students learn how to find and use digital information for research as well as how question, analyze, summarize, and interpret it. The class is centered around using digital tools to ask and answer historical questions but is also grounded in traditional historical pedagogy including rigorous reading and writing.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amanda-regan.com/390summer19&#34;&gt;Summer 2019&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amanda-regan.com/390spring19&#34;&gt;Spring 2019&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Fall 2018 - &lt;a href=&#34;http://amanda-regan.com/390fall18-2/&#34;&gt;Section 02&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://amanda-regan.com/390fall18-3/&#34;&gt;Section 3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://amanda-regan.com/390summer18/&#34;&gt;Summer 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://amanda-regan.com/390summer17/&#34;&gt;Summer 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;north-virginia-community-college&#34;&gt;North Virginia Community College&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;History 121: U.S. History to 1865&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amanda-regan.com/121su18&#34;&gt;Summer 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;digital-humanities-workshops&#34;&gt;Digital Humanities Workshops&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In addition to teaching traditional history courses at the university level, I also often teach workshops on digital tools and methodologies.

      <title>Using Custom Fields with PressForward and Wordpress</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the questions that the PressForward team gets repeatedly is how publications can use custom fields to automatically print data about a post once it is published. Publications often wish to display a generic name, such as “The Editors,” on a post rather than the name of the user who published the post. On Digital Humanities Now we use custom fields to store the names of our Editors-at-Large for the week a piece is featured as well as the name of the Editor-in-Chief for that week.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It seems like just yesterday we walked into the Center for History and New Media a bit unsure about what our first year as DH fellows would entail. Looking back it has been an extremely rewarding and valuable experience. Last fall we blogged about our rotations in both the &lt;a href=&#34;http://chnm.gmu.edu/courses/fellowship/?p=379&#34;&gt;Education&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://chnm.gmu.edu/courses/fellowship/?p=416&#34;&gt;Public Projects&lt;/a&gt; divisions. In the Spring we moved to Research for seven weeks where we worked on a programming project for &lt;a href=&#34;http://thatcamp.org&#34;&gt;THATCamp&lt;/a&gt; and on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://pressforward.org&#34;&gt;PressForward&lt;/a&gt; project before moving onto a seminar about the history of CHNM. I want to use this blog post to reflect on the spring semester and look back at the year as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Digital History Minor Field, Part 5: Topic Modeling</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week our readings focused on Topic Modeling. I’ve been looking forward to this week for some time partly because I plan to use Topic Modeling for my dissertation but also because  I was eager to understand some of the theoretical underpinnings of the methodology.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;During the Digital History Fellows in the Research Division  last spring, we were asked to do a &lt;a href=&#34;http://chnm.gmu.edu/courses/fellowship/?p=470&#34;&gt;topic modeling project&lt;/a&gt; on all of the blog posts from the the various THATCamps. We jumped in, attempted to learn python, managed to download every blog post from each THATCamp (well over 200), and then ran that data through MALLET for topic modeling. To make a very long story short, we managed to mess up the topic modeling and, consequently, our results for a variety of reasons. We encountered a number  of challenges but the results were skewed mostly because we didn’t understand the black box that is MALLET. However, although the project turned out to be a mess, I came to the readings this week with a bit of background on topic modeling and have gained a new perspective on the mistakes made during that project. (I think the project also has some lessons regarding failure in the digital humanities, but I’ll come back to that in another blog post.)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Minor Field Readings, Part 4: Space</title>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/minor-field-readings-part-4-space/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m a few weeks behind with this blog post about our minor field readings meeting on Space in Digital History. For this meeting we read a variety of works that discussed Geographic Information Systems (GIS), spatial history, the possibilities and and the complexities of presenting historical material geographically using digital technology and methodologies.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;GIS has been around for years now, yet historians have never embraced it like geographers have. Partly, as many of the authors point out, this is because of the software’s need for exact data rather than fuzzy or general information. Geographic coordinates must be exact rather than general which poses a problem for historians who don’t have exact data. Further, the software doesn’t handle change over time, a necessity for historians, well. In the &lt;em&gt;Spatial Humanities: GIS and the Future of Humanities Scholarship&lt;/em&gt; Bodengier et. al. discuss the limitations that GIS has “privileged a certain way of knowing the world, one that valued authority, definition, and certainty over complexity, ambiguity, multiplicity, and contingency….” [1. Bodengier et. al, ix]. This edited volume containing influential voices in the field of GIS, calls for and discusses the ways that GIS must move beyond the quantitative to the qualitative in order to appeal and be of use to historians. However, the emergence of the semantic web, Google Maps and other APIs, as well as Geolocated mobile devices have appealed more to historians looking to geolocate their work.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This weeks readings on “Changing Theories of History” discussed the ways digital methods are changing how historians practice or “do” history.  Several authors discussed how digital research methods change the scale of materials that we can draw upon while researching a topic.  Others discussed the possibility of using visualizations to communicate historical arguments rather than narrative.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Armitage and Guildi discuss in their article “The Return of the &lt;em&gt;Longue Duree&lt;/em&gt;: An Anglo-American Perspective” the origins of the Longue Duree and the shift away from histories that seek to tell the grand macro-narrative to the small focused micro-histories of the 1980s.  Braudel, the original advocate of the Longue Duree, argued that histories in cycles of ten or twenty years don’t capture the “deeper regularities and continuities underlying the processes of change.”[1. David Armitage and Jo Guildi, &lt;a href=&#34;http://scholar.harvard.edu/files/armitage/files/rld_annales_revised_0.pdf&#34;&gt;“The Return of the _Longue Duree: _An Anglo American Perspective”&lt;/a&gt;] Beginning in the 1980s most historians moved away from approaches that focused on large time scales and felt a need to specialize because of the influx of graduate students to the profession.  As a result, micro-history flourished and represented a shift toward “generalization about the aggregate to micro-politics and the successes or failures of particular battles within the larger class struggles.”[2. Armitage and Guildi, 16] Since the 1980s, Historians have continued to write histories that have focused on manageable time spans, narrow topics, or individual locations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The readings contemplate what new media tools and technologies change for how we think about, produce, and evaluate information.  Out of these readings came a consistent concern with scale, linearity, and how digital technologies and tools will affect narrative, or for my purposes, a historical argument.  The assumption has long been that reputable scholarship, at least for historians, is written, linear, and is composed in a narrative.  That’s what our profession values.  However, this is (hopefully) beginning to change due to new media and how it has fundamentally changed “how we think.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Minor Field Readings, Part 1: Digital Humanities</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/dhs-histories-debates-promises/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This summer I am completing a readings course for my &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amanda-regan.com/digital-history-minor-field/&#34;&gt;minor field in Digital History&lt;/a&gt;.  This weeks readings have discussed the digital humanities, the history of the field, and have offered critiques as well as predictions about where the field is going.  Most volumes about Digital Humanities discuss the history of the field and place its origins in the history of humanities computing.  While there is certainly truth in these accounts, they often overlook the histories of disciplines such as history and how these fields merged together to form the “Digital Humanities” around 2004.  This week&amp;rsquo;s readings have coincided with the recent conversations about the digital humanities by  by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.foundhistory.org/2014/04/07/the-dividends-of-difference-recognizing-digital-humanities-diverse-family-trees/&#34;&gt;Tom Schienfelt&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://drstephenrobertson.com/2014/05/23/the-differences-between-digital-history-and-digital-humanities/&#34;&gt;Stephen Robertson&lt;/a&gt;. The current discussion about the fragmentation of the Digital Humanities into disciplines makes reading about the debates, critiques, and trends in the Digital Humanities even more interesting.  While history is most certainly part of the digital humanities conversation (and I’m not arguing that it shouldn’t be) I think it is useful to look at the issues in the field from the perspective of an aspiring digital historian and to discuss how they might be relevant to those of us looking to create digital dissertations and those of us preparing to enter the job market in the next six years.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This summer I&amp;rsquo;ll be completing a readings course for my Digital History minor field with Stephen Robertson.  The course will cover Digital History in both Theory and Practice.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can view the proposed abstract and bibliography for this course &lt;a href=&#34;http://wp.me/P3WbUx-aR&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  In addition to a traditional readings course, I felt it was important to not only understand the major debates in the field but also to learn practical skills that will aid me as I move toward the dissertation stage.  The practical skills will be achieved by incorporating Clio III: Programming for Historians into the minor field.  I’ll be taking that course in fall 2014 with Lincoln Mullen.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I still have a few small changes to make but for the most part my final project for Clio II is finished.  I&amp;rsquo;d like to go back and add a few more primary sources and I still need to fix the gallery of reducing advertisements.  Also, the footnotes have mysteriously gone missing on one of my pages so I need to fix that too.  I&amp;rsquo;ll get to those things over the next day or so, but in the meantime you can view it &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amanda-regan.com/Reduceomania/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about the final project and trying to make some decisions about design so that I can finish coding the basics of the site over the next week or so.  I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to do the website on the &amp;ldquo;Reducing Craze&amp;rdquo; of 1920.  It&amp;rsquo;ll look at the American Medical Association&amp;rsquo;s condemnation of quackery in 1927 and the rejection of what was deemed &amp;ldquo;Reduceosanity&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For fonts I&amp;rsquo;ve decided on several google fonts that I&amp;rsquo;ll layer to create a 1920s feel.  Federo has an art deco feel and I think will look good blown up really big.  I&amp;rsquo;m thinking about putting a slight shadow on the h1 to make it pop on the textured background I have in mind.  The second font, is Buda which I am going to use for the navigation and possibly for blockquotes and pull quotes too.  Finally, the body font is going to be Lato because I think it&amp;rsquo;ll work nicely with the other too.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been slowly making progress on my image assignment.  One of the things I&amp;rsquo;ve been attempting to do is to restore some images that were part of a scrapbook I scanned while I was working on my masters.  The scrapbook contained magazine and newspaper clippings that were glued onto pages and tied together with some twine.  Unfortunately, after being stored in a closet for seventy plus years the pages are crumbling, the photos are yellowed, and most of the photos have some odd crease in them likely from the glue that was used.  To make matters worse, some of the items in the scrapbook were stuck together with paper clips which then rusted and caused a huge mess.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on making some of the small changes to my &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amanda-regan.com/2014/02/22/typography-assignment/&#34;&gt;typography project&lt;/a&gt; that we discussed in class last week.  Most of the spacing fixes and the changes to the lines were super easy to fix but restoring the comic has taken a bit of time.  I played with doing different things to it, but the challenge with this particular image was that because it was printed from a microfilm reader (and then scanned) the image&amp;rsquo;s quality is pretty poor even though the resolution is high.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The last couple weeks we&amp;rsquo;ve been reading about color and the do&amp;rsquo;s and don&amp;rsquo;ts of picking a color scheme. I think the reading in &lt;em&gt;White Space is Not Your Enemy&lt;/em&gt; was very helpful and got me thinking about the color scheme for the design project.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Something that was extremely useful for me was the explanation of the differences between CMYK, PANTONE, and RGB. Prior to reading this I sort of understood the difference just from experience but the reading really pinpointed what each system is for, when to use it, and how it works. I think understanding how color is generated on a screen will factor into how I choose color schemes and design my final project.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The original post, which was collectively written by the DH Fellows, can be found on our &lt;a href=&#34;http://chnm.gmu.edu/courses/fellowship/&#34;&gt;Digital History Fellowship Blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We have spent the last few weeks working to build a python script that would allow us to download and prep all of the THATCamp blog posts for topic modeling in MALLET (for those catching up, we detailed this process in a series of &lt;a href=&#34;http://chnm.gmu.edu/courses/fellowship/&#34;&gt;previous posts&lt;/a&gt;). As our last post &lt;a href=&#34;http://chnm.gmu.edu/courses/fellowship/?p=448&#34;&gt;detailed&lt;/a&gt;, we encountered a few more complications than expected due to foreign languages in the corpus of the text.  After some discussion, we worked through these issues and were able to add stoplists to the script for German, French, and Spanish.  Although this didn’t solve all of our issues and some terms do still show up (we didn’t realize there was Dutch too), it led to some interesting discussion about the methodology behind topic modeling.  Finally we were able to rerun the python script with the new stopwords and then feed this new data into MALLET.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amanda-regan.com/ClioWired2/Portfolio/Typography/&#34;&gt;typography assignment &lt;/a&gt;I decided to make a page using some of the content from my masters thesis. I said last week I wasn&amp;rsquo;t going to use my thesis for this class, but then I decided that for this assignment it might be kind of fun. I&amp;rsquo;ll get back to physical culture in the progressive era for the design and final assignments. I pieced together some text from my thesis that introduces a woman named Sylvia Ullback who was a beauty expert to the Hollywood stars in the 1920s. I thought this content would make for a fun design and a creative use of fonts. For this weeks blog post, I thought I&amp;rsquo;d explain my thought process and justify some of the decisions I made while designing this page.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Having overcome the hurdles of writing some python script and using MySQL to grab content from tables in the backend of a Wordpress install, we moved on to the relatively straightforward process of running our stripped text files through MALLET.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

In this post, we will continue with this project and work to clean up the data we&amp;rsquo;ve collected and prepare it for some analysis. This process is known as &amp;ldquo;pre-processing&amp;rdquo;. After running our script in the THATCamp database all of the posts were collected and saved as text files. At this stage, the files are filled with extraneous information relating to the structure of the posts. Most of these are tags and metadata that would disrupt any attempts to look across the dataset. Our task here was to clean them up so they could be fed into MALLET. In order to do this, we needed to strip the html tags, remove punctuation, and remove common stopwords. To do this, we used chunks of code from the &lt;a href=&#34;http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/from-html-to-list-of-words-1&#34;&gt;Programming Historian&amp;rsquo;s lesson on text analysis&lt;/a&gt; with python and modified the code to work with the files we had already downloaded.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The reading for this week in _Thinking with Type _about grids was extremely interesting to me.  The section about tables and grids in html particularly peaked my interest.  I think the hardest part of html and css is learning layout but I think a grid makes the whole idea of layout easier to understand.  I&amp;rsquo;ve always used grids when I code, particularly I like the &lt;a href=&#34;http://960.gs&#34;&gt;960 grid system&lt;/a&gt; which makes layout very easy and allows you to work of a variety of grid layouts.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

As &lt;a href=&#34;http://chnm.gmu.edu/courses/fellowship/?p=421&#34;&gt;Jannelle described last week&lt;/a&gt;, our goal was to write a script that downloads the blog posts in plain text form and strips all of the html tags, stopwords, and punctuation so that we can feed it into MALLET for topic modeling and text analysis. After several long days and a lot of help from second year fellow Spencer Roberts, we&amp;rsquo;ve successfully gotten the code to work.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

As someone new to DH, with admittedly limited technical skill and knowledge, these were immeasurably useful. Each tutorial breaks content into smaller, less intimidating units. These can be completed in succession or selected for a particular topic or skill. While there is useful content for anyone, we focused our attention on &lt;a href=&#34;http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/introduction-and-installation&#34;&gt;Python&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/topic-modeling-and-mallet&#34;&gt;Topic Modeling&lt;/a&gt; with the aim of solving our own programming dilemma.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week&amp;rsquo;s materials on Typography were really interesting. I especially enjoyed Morris&amp;rsquo;s article &lt;a href=&#34;http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/08/08/hear-all-ye-people-hearken-o-earth/#ftn1&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Hear, All Ye People; Hearken, O Earth.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; I&amp;rsquo;ve always been interested in Typography but I had never realized the extent to which a typeface can affect the credibility of a site. Typography is one of the most important, if not the most important, element in the design of a website yet it&amp;rsquo;s something that we rarely consciously think about. The question Morris asks is &amp;ldquo;Can we separate form and content?&amp;rdquo;. Many of us can but that&amp;rsquo;s because as historians we&amp;rsquo;re trained to do so. The majority of users on the internet aren&amp;rsquo;t checking the facts presented, aren&amp;rsquo;t looking at the site&amp;rsquo;s metadata, and are judging the site based on its visual appeal.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week&amp;rsquo;s readings, specifically Stephen Ramsey&amp;rsquo;s article &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://stephenramsay.us/text/2011/01/08/whos-in-and-whos-out/&#34;&gt;Who&amp;rsquo;s In? Who&amp;rsquo;s Out?&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;rdquo; really got me thinking about (again) about how Digital History is defined and why (or if) coding is an important skill for any digital historian. There are a large number of tools available to allow historians to analyze sources and make arguments using technology, many that don&amp;rsquo;t require a significant amount of coding knowledge. Specifically, I&amp;rsquo;m thinking of something such as MALLET, which a number of us used for our final Clio I projects.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m all finished with my first semester in the PhD program at George Mason University. Below is a reflection on the time the Digital History Fellows have spent in the Public Projects Division at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://chnm.gmu.edu&#34;&gt;Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and New Media&lt;/a&gt;.  My first semester here has been deeply rewarding and I think the Digital History Fellowship has allowed me to really develop a deeper understanding of Digital History and the goals for both public history, education, and particularly the potential of digital tools for historical research.  Next semester we begin Clio Wired II, a required course for PhD students, where we will build a website completely from html and css.  (The following was originally posted on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://chnm.gmu.edu/courses/fellowship/&#34;&gt;Digital History Fellows Blog&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The final version of my Clio Wired Project, &lt;a href=&#34;www.amanda-regan.com/cliof13&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Shifts in Physical Culture,&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; is online now. It has been quite the process getting everything formatted correctly&amp;ndash;I realized after I presented that I had made a mistake and did not included all of the articles when I ran the topic modeling software so I had to adjust that. Overall the results are the same&amp;ndash;there is a definite change in the discussion of physical culture between 1932 and 1937.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My work of digital scholarship uses Topic Modeling to analyze a set of articles written by Sylvia Ullback, a beauty expert in the 1930s, between 1932 and 1937.  Ullback&amp;rsquo;s articles shift during this period and the change in her discussion of beauty can be seen in the topic models.  For more background on Sylvia Ullback and her career see &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amanda-regan.com/cliof13&#34;&gt;the website for this project&lt;/a&gt;.  This is a work in progress and I&amp;rsquo;ll give more detail about the changes tonight in class but here is what I have so far:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Digital Humanities and Collaboration</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Collaboration isn’t new for historians.  A piece of historical scholarship has always involved a range of people.  The prologue of most traditional monographs includes a list of those who helped make the book possible.  From the support and assistance of archivists and librarians, to review and support by fellow scholars and students, and often financial support from institutions and publishers publishing a work of traditional scholarship is by no means an individual endeavor.  However, traditional works of scholarship are not typically described as collaborative.  Digital Technology allows and requires collaboration in two, more visible, ways.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I TA’d for the first time last spring, my last semester in my masters program.  It was the first time I had ever taught and I quickly learned that leading a discussion section and getting freshman interested in World History was challenging.  I came away from the semester realizing, what may be obvious to those more experienced teachers, that teaching history to undergrads from a variety of majors is more difficult that it appears.  I think a large part of the challenge with my class was dealing with English Language Learners.  It took me about three-quarters of the semester to realize that it wasn’t that the students weren’t reading, it was that they had trouble reading documents written in the ancient world.  Many of them didn’t bring this to my attention, but as the semester progressed I began to realize that they were having trouble reading and understanding documents from Ancient Egypt or Mesopotamia so discussing them became even more difficult.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Big Data for Historians</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Franco Moretti’s article “Graphs, Maps, and Trees: Abstract Models for Literary History,” shows how most histories of the book have focused on a few particular books rather than the novel as a genre.  This has probably had to do with scale.  It would be an overwhelming and almost impossible task to read every single novel in order to write a comprehensive and all-encompassing history of the novel.  However, this is where Big Data allows historians to look at large trends in ways that are impractical without computers.  Moretti shows how the history of the novel can be looked at numerically and graphically using big data techniques.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Mapping Regional Ideals of Beauty, 1900-1940: A Digital Research Resouce</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As I&amp;rsquo;ve mentioned a few times before I am interested in ideas about the body and beauty in the early twentieth century.  My digital resource is a research tool that would help me to analyze the mass amounts of newspaper articles available.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Between 1900 and 1940 there were several distinct shifts in the ideas of beauty and physical culture for women in the United States.  Shifts in the image and role of the New Woman, from the Gibson Girl to the Flapper, were accompanied by changes in the ideal female body.  The 1920s were dominated by a “Reducing Craze” which gave way in the late 1920s to a more sensible and health based routine of diet and exercise.  This model of physical culture lasted throughout most of the 1930s but began to decline, for reasons that are complex, in the late 1930s.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Spatial History as a Research Tool</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In Richard White&amp;rsquo;s article &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.stanford.edu/group/spatialhistory/cgi-bin/site/pub.php?id=29&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;What is Spatial History?,&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; he discusses the turn to spatial history and the ways in which it can be used as a research tool to enhance historical scholarship. His article was fascinating and really got me thinking about different spatial history projects I&amp;rsquo;ve seen. Two that come to mind is &lt;a href=&#34;http://dsl.richmond.edu/emancipation/&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Visualizing Emancipation&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;, run by Scott Nesbit and Edward Ayers at the University of Richmond&amp;rsquo;s Digital Scholarship Lab, and &lt;a href=&#34;http://users.humboldt.edu/mstephens/hate/hate_map.html&#34;&gt;The Geography of Hate&lt;/a&gt;, run by Monica Stephens at Humboldt State University. I also have been thinking about mapping for my own research and what that might look like and how it might enhance my research.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I posted these in the Zotero group, but I thought I would add them here as well.  I think these are two interesting examples of spatial history.  &lt;a href=&#34;http://mappingdecline.lib.uiowa.edu/&#34;&gt;Mapping Decline: St. Louis and the American City&lt;/a&gt; is an example of using a spatial history component to bolster an argument.  We have been talking about Digital History and whether it needs to make an argument all semester and I think _Mapping Decline _is a great example of a project that does that.  &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mappingdubois.org/&#34;&gt;Mapping the Du Bois Philadelphia Negro&lt;/a&gt; is another example of a spatial history project which could, and I think is intended to be, a research tool.  The project doesn&amp;rsquo;t currently offer any analysis, but they do list several research questions they hope to answer on the home page.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;*This was blog post was originally posted on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://chnm.gmu.edu&#34;&gt;Center for History and New Media&amp;rsquo;s blog&lt;/a&gt; as part of my &lt;a href=&#34;http://chnm.gmu.edu/news/digital-history-fellows-at-rrchnm/&#34;&gt;Digital History Fellowship&lt;/a&gt; at George Mason University.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;How can technology help teachers to teach historical and critical thinking?  Getting students to think critically about historical events rather than just memorizing the facts is challenging, but digital technology can help.  With so many new digital tools being developed each year, teachers are eager for resources to help locate free, quality tools that can help students become better critical thinkers and historians.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>On the Overwhelming Challenge of Preserving Born Digital Materials</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.digitalpreservation.gov/documents/ndiipp_plan.pdf&#34;&gt;Preserving our Digital Heritage:&lt;/a&gt; Plan for the National Digital Information Infrastructure and Preservation Program stated that the average length of a website is 44 days. That really surprised me. I think the preservation of born digital material is an important issue right now, and it&amp;rsquo;s only going to get more important as our world increasingly becomes more digital. It is really an overwhelming issue with so many hurdles and potential issues.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I came across a project of Berry College and Bloomsberg University this week called the &lt;a href=&#34;https://mbda.berry.edu&#34;&gt;Martha Berry Digital Archive&lt;/a&gt;.  The site is built on &lt;a href=&#34;http://omeka.org/&#34;&gt;Omeka &lt;/a&gt;and a plugin the developers created for the site called &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/gsbodine/crowd-ed&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Crowd-Ed&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;.  The plugin allows the digitization of their entire collection to be crowdsourced.  In other words, the archive digitizes the documents and users annotate, tag, and fill in the metadata for each item.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Crowdsourcing has been gaining popularity recently and has become a way for archives to digitize mass amounts of data fairly quickly and at a minimal cost.  The &lt;a href=&#34;http://transcribe.archives.gov/&#34;&gt;National Archives and Records Administration&lt;/a&gt; began doing this in January 2012 and have allowed users to transcribe, tag, and edit documents all online.  Later in 2012, the technology used by the National Archives was released as open-source.  The overwhelming popularity of crowdsourcing with the public has led many other archives to begin doing the same thing.  &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ancestry.com/&#34;&gt; Ancestry.com&lt;/a&gt; used it to transcribe the 1940 census (although then they charged for access to the census&amp;ndash;not cool).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I attended &lt;a href=&#34;http://2013.baltimore.wordcamp.org/&#34;&gt;WordCamp Baltimore&lt;/a&gt;, a WordPress developers conference.  &lt;a href=&#34;http://aaron.jorb.in/&#34;&gt;Aaron Jorbin&lt;/a&gt;, a well-known WordPress developer in the D.C. area, gave the keynote address which was about open source platforms and the open source community.  If you aren&amp;rsquo;t familiar with the &amp;ldquo;.org&amp;rdquo; version of WordPress, it is open source and free to anyone who wants to use, modify, or develop the software.  Jorbin&amp;rsquo;s keynote was entitled &amp;ldquo;Citizenship in the Open Source World&amp;rdquo; and he talked a lot about the responsibilities and the rights of a citizen in the &amp;ldquo;Open Source World.&amp;rdquo;  Jorbin argued that in the &amp;ldquo;Open Source World,&amp;rdquo; the free flow of information is crucial and as citizens we have the responsibility to share knowledge because open source is a team sport.  The freedoms of this world include the freedom to learn, to use, to change, and to distribute.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Webdesign for Academics </title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Web Design is not something academic are traditionally trained in.  However, as the discipline continues to change and Digital History continues to develop and grow, knowing a little bit about what constitutes a good historical website is necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Alexander Dawson makes excellent points about the development and organization of a website in his article &lt;a href=&#34;http://sixrevisions.com/usabilityaccessibility/improve-site-usability-by-studying-museums/&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Improve Usability by Studying Museums.&amp;rdquo; &lt;/a&gt; He compares the layout of a museum to that of a website and argues that many web designers could take some tips from the organization of museums.  Among these include creating a set of very clear navigational aids or bread crumbs for users as they navigate through the website, creating appropriate documentation such as help guides and FAQ&amp;rsquo;s for users, and featuring important or new items prominently on the front of the site.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;What are the digital humanities, what do they do, and how does digital history fit in? It’s a valid question and one that I think has several answers.&lt;a href=&#34;http://sites.library.northwestern.edu/dh/&#34;&gt;Northwestern University’s “A Guide to Digital Humanities”&lt;/a&gt;confronts this question and attempts to make sense of the many different definitions that exist for Digital Humanities. The consensus seems to be that the Digital Humanities are centered on scholarship.  The digital humanities are both a methodology and a presentation technique.  Building and using digital tools, presenting research in digital form, and critiquing and experimenting with digital technology are all within the field of Digital Humanities.  Digital History then aims to build tools that enhance historical research, make historical documents and records more accessible, and to present historical scholarship in digital form.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
