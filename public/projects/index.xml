      <title>Shaping Up: Physical Fitness Initatives for Women, 1880-1965</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Beginning in 1880 and ending during the Cold War, &lt;em&gt;Shaping Up&lt;/em&gt; examines why the fitness of female bodies was a matter of national concern and interest. It argues that the shape of the female body and the discourses surrounding it were frequently correlated with larger social, political and economic issues. While the definition of being “in shape” or acquiring “shapeliness” changed numerous times between 1880 and 1965, the patriarchal focus on developing fit female bodies remained a constant and served various economic, social, and political purposes. Whether spurred by fears about the increasing levels of  undesirable or “unfit” immigrants and their potential effect on the Anglo-Saxon race; a concern about mixed sex amusements in the modern city and the “excess energy” that drove working women to seek out such amusements; or the economic necessity of women’s participation in war work, which required fitness, but threatened gender hierarchies and the appeal of the female body for the male gaze, fitness was a tool in the repertoire of physical educators, reformers, and state actors who sought to shape behavior and inscribe their values onto the female body in reaction to social anxieties. Each chapter explores a moment when the fitness of the female body became an issue of national concern.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

An LGBT equivalent to the African American “green books,” the Damron guides contained lists of bars, bathhouses, cinemas, hotels, advocacy organizations and cruising sites in every U.S. state. MGG seeks to associate geographical coordinates with each location mentioned within the Damron Guides and provide an interface for visualizing and stuyding the growth in LGBTQ sites between 1965 and 2005. Made up of a public-facing and freely available web app as well as a series of digital vignettes that analyze the data using historical context, MGG stands to make a significant contribution to scholars understanding of the ways in which LGBTQ people negotiated and appropriated public space to form community.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;image-right&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/portfolio-dhnow.png&#34; height=&#34;350px&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;em&gt;Digital Humanities Now&lt;/em&gt; is PressForward’s flagship publication which seeks to curate and publish scholarly literature such as white papers and grant reports that otherwise may not have had a venue for publication. Using the PressForward plugin and relying on a community of volunteer editors, &lt;em&gt;DHNow&lt;/em&gt; has sought to encourage scholars to share their research and learned expertise on the open web. DHNow had developed methodologies and technologies to facilitate the aggregation and curation of gray literature-scholarly work (white papers, presentations, research reports, essays etc.) that may not otherwise have a formal venue for publication.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Mining My Day: Using Text Analysis to Understand Eleanor Roosevelt&#39;s Newspaper Columns</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/projects/mininger/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;image-right&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/portfolio-miningmyday.png&#34; height=&#34;350px&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;em&gt;Mining My Day&lt;/em&gt; is a &lt;a href=&#34;http://shinyapps.io&#34;&gt;Shiny&lt;/a&gt; app that visualizes the common themes, or &amp;rsquo;topics&amp;rsquo;, in Eleanor Roosevelt&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;My Day&lt;/em&gt; columns. You can &lt;a href=&#34;http://amanda-regan.com/2017/05/mining-eleanor-roosevelts-my-day-columns/&#34;&gt;read the blog post about the visualization&lt;/a&gt; or jump straight into &lt;a href=&#34;https://regan008.shinyapps.io/mining_my_day/&#34;&gt;exploring the app.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;From December 1935 until September 1962, Roosevelt authored a nationally syndicated newspaper column entitled &lt;em&gt;My Day&lt;/em&gt; and because Roosevelt did not keep any sort of diary and her appointment books were often incomplete, the &lt;em&gt;My Day&lt;/em&gt; columns have become a valuable source for historians. The columns, authored six days a week until January 1961 and then three days a week thereafter, represent the only consistent account of her public activities. Thanks to the work of the Eleanor Roosevelt Papers’ staff, who transcribed each My Day column and made them available online, anyone with internet access can now explore this important piece of history.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

First, as the Graduate Research Assistant, and later the Software Development Manager, I collaborated with team members to outline development priorities and milestone goals while also overseeing the testing and release processes. I also built the &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;PressForward TurnKey Theme&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; which allows publications to make PressForward statistics easily viewable by readers. In 2017 I undertook redesigning the PressFoward.org website.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

We designed an information architecture that would capture the data contained on the coversheet of grant applications and we each input documents related to one of the center&amp;rsquo;s major projects. The item metadata is designed in a way that is meant to be flexible and allow researchers to use the API to ask and answer questions about the history of RRCHNM.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
