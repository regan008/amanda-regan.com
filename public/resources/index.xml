      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you are in a Ph.D. program, you are training to be a professional historian. As part of that training you will build a base of knowledge and familiarity with key works of historical scholarship in your field. Its a good idea to develop a system early in your career for taking notes and keeping track of everything you&amp;rsquo;ve read. You never know when you&amp;rsquo;ll need to come back to a book.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Students in the Digital History Ph.D. program at Clemson University prepare comprehensive portfolios in lieu of a traditional comprehensive exam. A component of that portfolio includes annotated syllabi for each of the three fields. The exact topics and breakdown of those 3 syllabi should be discussed with your advisory committee during your Portfolio Plan meeting which typically is filled out the semester before you prepare and defend your portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Please note that these are Dr. Reganâ€™s guidelines for annotated syllabi. If you are not preparing a portfolio for Dr. Regan you should check with your advisory committee about standards and guidelines for the annotated syllabi.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
