    <p>If you are in a Ph.D. program, you are training to be a professional historian. As part of that training you will build a base of knowledge and familiarity with key works of historical scholarship in your field. Its a good idea to develop a system early in your career for taking notes and keeping track of everything you&rsquo;ve read. You never know when you&rsquo;ll need to come back to a book.</p>
<p>What follows is one example of a template for taking notes called THOMAS. THOMAS is a Mnemonic device for topic, historiography, organization, methodology, argument, and So What? or the stakes/significance.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Use this outline to take notes as you read and then conclude your work on the book or piece of scholarship by writing a short summary or precis that summarizes the book. It should include a snopsis, the argument, key findings, and evidence.</p>

<li><strong>Historiography</strong> - What debates is this book intervening in? What does it add to/challenge in these conversations?</li>
<li><strong>Organization -</strong> Is it thematic chronological, innovative in any way? What can we learn by closely studying the table of contents about the hierarchy of the book&rsquo;s argument, or by looking at the chapters&rsquo; internal structure?</li>
<li><strong>Methodology -</strong> What methods does this book use? Which archives? What approach does it take to analyzing its sources?</li>
<li><strong>Argument -</strong> What is this authorâ€™s original thesis? What new thing does it explain?</li>
<li><strong>So What? Or Stakes/Significance -</strong> For readers who have no interest in the specifics of the topic of even the argument, why would this book be useful?</li>
