    <p>The final version of my Clio Wired Project, <a href="www.amanda-regan.com/cliof13">&ldquo;Shifts in Physical Culture,&rdquo;</a> is online now. It has been quite the process getting everything formatted correctly&ndash;I realized after I presented that I had made a mistake and did not included all of the articles when I ran the topic modeling software so I had to adjust that. Overall the results are the same&ndash;there is a definite change in the discussion of physical culture between 1932 and 1937.</p>
<p>I added one other element to my project to help support my argument.  I used the Google N-Gram viewer to show how the term &ldquo;physical culture&rdquo; has occurred in books from 1800 to 2000. The result confirms what I suspected&ndash;there is a large drop in the term beginning in 1935. The graph doesn&rsquo;t help me answer why, although I have my suspicions, but it does give me a starting point for further research.</p>
<p>Although, I think what I learned from this project is, first, that topic modeling is incredibly useful and a really neat tool for  analyzing text. Secondly, I need to experiment with looking at physical culture on a much larger scale using topic modeling. (although thats a whole other&ndash;big&ndash;project.) Adding some of the digitized books from online archives such as google books and HathiTrust would allow me to look more closely at physical culture as a trend. I think incorporating some text from health and diet gurus such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernarr_Macfadden">Bernarr Macfadden</a> would make for a really interesting analysis.</p>
<p>Its been a great semester&ndash;see you all in the Spring for Round 2!</p>
