    <p>Web Design is not something academic are traditionally trained in.  However, as the discipline continues to change and Digital History continues to develop and grow, knowing a little bit about what constitutes a good historical website is necessary.</p>
<p>Alexander Dawson makes excellent points about the development and organization of a website in his article <a href="http://sixrevisions.com/usabilityaccessibility/improve-site-usability-by-studying-museums/">&ldquo;Improve Usability by Studying Museums.&rdquo; </a> He compares the layout of a museum to that of a website and argues that many web designers could take some tips from the organization of museums.  Among these include creating a set of very clear navigational aids or bread crumbs for users as they navigate through the website, creating appropriate documentation such as help guides and FAQ&rsquo;s for users, and featuring important or new items prominently on the front of the site.</p>
<p>While I think Dawson makes some excellent points, I also think that the design of a site depends on the audience and purpose of a site.  An archive will be organized very differently than a website that seeks to feature scholarship more prominently.  The archive might feature a exhibit but often would provide a useable and intuitive navigational structure so that the reader can easily explore the collections without being guided in a linear fashion.  A work of scholarship on the web, I think has different objectives.</p>
<p>The presence of web platforms such as Wordpress, Joomla, and Omeka make it easier to design a website without knowing much about web design.  However, knowing basics such as the difference between fonts, layout structures, and navigational design can go a long way on an academic website.  Good design is vital to maintaining a readership.</p>
