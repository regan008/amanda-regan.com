<article class="blog-post">
    <p>For the <a href="http://www.amanda-regan.com/ClioWired2/Portfolio/Typography/">typography assignment </a>I decided to make a page using some of the content from my masters thesis. I said last week I wasn&rsquo;t going to use my thesis for this class, but then I decided that for this assignment it might be kind of fun. I&rsquo;ll get back to physical culture in the progressive era for the design and final assignments. I pieced together some text from my thesis that introduces a woman named Sylvia Ullback who was a beauty expert to the Hollywood stars in the 1920s. I thought this content would make for a fun design and a creative use of fonts. For this weeks blog post, I thought I&rsquo;d explain my thought process and justify some of the decisions I made while designing this page.</p>
<p>Before I began the design, I spent some time thinking about old Hollywood, fan magazines, Sylvia, and the tone and feeling that I wanted the page to display. When thinking of old hollywood black and white immediately comes to mind but I wanted to do something a little more exciting in terms of color.</p>
<p>[caption id=&ldquo;attachment_583&rdquo; align=&ldquo;alignleft&rdquo; width=&ldquo;150&rdquo;]<a href="http://www.amanda-regan.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/resized_3_modernscreen-1936.png"><img src="http://www.amanda-regan.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/resized_3_modernscreen-1936-150x150.png" alt="This is the article that contains  the cartoon used in my typography assignment.  "></a> This is the article that contains the cartoon used in my typography assignment.[/caption]</p>
<p>I also knew I had a image that I had cut out from one of Sylvia&rsquo;s articles in _ Modern Screen_ magazine. The is a hand drawn comic strip showing a woman entering Sylvia&rsquo;s shop, being transformed physically and leaving svelte and thin looking like a new woman. This image was black and white though and I wanted to add some color to the page. I decided to use a background that is a teal color with a slight diagonal stripe to it and have elements of a light reddish color on the page. I wanted the color scheme to be fun and reflect the playful tone in much of Sylvia&rsquo;s writing (really some of the articles are a great laugh).</p>
<p>For the headings at the very top of my page I decided to go with a classic, but readable script like the ones often used in film title cards. I ended up going with the google font &lsquo;Dancing Script&rsquo; after much debate. I wanted to use this font for the beginning of the tile &lsquo;As Lovely as the Stars of&quot; and use a different font for &ldquo;Hollywood&rdquo;.</p>
<p>[caption id=&ldquo;attachment_584&rdquo; align=&ldquo;alignleft&rdquo; width=&ldquo;150&rdquo;]<a href="http://www.amanda-regan.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Screen-Shot-2014-02-22-at-5.48.32-PM.png"><img src="http://www.amanda-regan.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Screen-Shot-2014-02-22-at-5.48.32-PM-150x150.png" alt="Typography assignment with the first font"></a> Typography assignment with the first font[/caption]</p>
<p>I had two fonts that I debated between for the word &ldquo;Hollywood&rdquo;. The first was font was designed to look like the hollywood sign and had a jagged baseline causing the text to look uneven. As you can see from the screenshot on the left, that quickly turned out to be a bad idea.  The second was a font that had a dotted inner outline and looked very much like the lights you might see on the outside of a movie theater.</p>
<p>[caption id=&ldquo;attachment_585&rdquo; align=&ldquo;alignright&rdquo; width=&ldquo;150&rdquo;]<a href="http://www.amanda-regan.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Screen-Shot-2014-02-22-at-5.45.08-PM.png"><img src="http://www.amanda-regan.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Screen-Shot-2014-02-22-at-5.45.08-PM-150x150.png" alt="Screenshot of the final font used for the typography assignment"></a> Screenshot of the final font used for the typography assignment[/caption]</p>
<p>I decided that this font fit the feel I was going for and looked good on the page. I played with using this same font for the subheadings and even for the navigation, but quickly decided that the font really only looked good very large and resorted to using a sans-serif for the headings instead.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll find more things that need to be fixed on the page over the weekend&mdash;but for now it is up on my site. <a href="http://www.amanda-regan.com/ClioWired2/Portfolio/Typography/">You can view the page here.</a>
