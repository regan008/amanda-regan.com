    <h3 id="course-description">Course Description</h3>
<p>Welcome to History 8510, Methods in Digital History II. This course in computational history will teach you to create, manipulate, explore, and visualize historical data with the goal of advancing historical arguments.</p>
<p>This class is the second in a series of digital history courses at Clemson University. It is designed to build on History 8500: Digital Methods I. In that course you reviewed digital history projects and methods, experimented with out of the box tools, and developed your own digital research collections. In this course we will build on that and you will now learn to use computational methods to analyze historical sources in the programming language R.</p>
<p>This course will break down into roughly four units. The first, will provide an overview of computational history and look at examples of historical scholarship that have relied on computational methods to make historical arguments. The second, will focus on creating methodologically transparent and clean datasets from primary sources. You will learn to document those datasets and methodologies in a reproducible manner using GitHub and version control. The next unit focuses on the basics of the programming with an emphasis on computational thinking skills and the foundational patterns behind every programming language. Finally, in the last half of our course, we will survey various methods within computational history and ask ourselves, what kinds of historical questions do these methods make possible? Each week will focus on a new method &ndash; visualization, mapping, text analysis, and network analysis. By the end of this course you&rsquo;ll have gained a basic familiarity and competency all of these approaches, but <strong>more importantly</strong> you&rsquo;ll understand how to ask and answer historical questions using the computational methods that are useful to you. At the conclusion of the course you will be prepared to produce a seminar paper in digital history and potentially employ digital methods for your dissertation.</p>
<h4 id="why-r">Why R?</h4>
<p>There are numerous languages we could learn in this course but we&rsquo;ll focus on R which is common in the field of digital history as well as data science. With roots in statistical analysis, R is a high level programming language (meaning further from machine code or really complicated languages like C++). However, more important than the specific language are the programming fundamentals you will learn. After this class you may decide that Python, PHP, Go, or any other number of programming languages better suits your needs based on the historical questions you want to ask. Learning these fundamentals will allow you to pivot as needed and learn new languages, syntaxes, and tools.</p>
<h4 id="a-note-on-data-and-sources-for-this-class">A Note on Data and Sources for this Class</h4>
<p>For the most part, I&rsquo;ve provided datasets for all of the assignments in this class so that you don&rsquo;t have to worry about learning the material <em>and</em> creating a historical dataset that will work with that approach. The only exception to this is the assignment on dataset creation but I will provided suggested primary source repositories in case you don&rsquo;t yet have a set of sources in mind. However, you are welcome (and encouraged) to use your own data for any assignment. Doing so will only further prepare you for your future classes in digital history and for your dissertation.</p>
<h3 id="learning-goals">Learning goals:</h3>
<p><strong>At the conclusion of this course you will:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>be able to use a computer programming language (R) to make historical arguments.</li>
<li>understand the basic computational patterns in programming.</li>
<li>Be able to use documentation for programming languages and libraries to learn skills as they become applicable to your work.</li>
<li>Be able to create historical data from primary sources.</li>
<li>Understand how to clean, organize, manipulate, and document that data.</li>
<li>Critically evaluate existing historical data.</li>
<li>be familiar with the major computational methodologies (i.e. mapping, text analysis etc) and what types of historical data and questions those methods are useful for. Understand their limitations and strengths.</li>
<li>Visualize your work and communicate your methods to other historians.</li>

<br>


<p><strong>Assignments:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Worksheets/Problem Sets &amp; Participation (40%):</strong> Most weeks you will complete a worksheet that is based on the method for the week. With a few exceptions, these worksheets will be due the week after we discuss that method. Worksheets will be R Markdown documents that allow you to blend code and prose and in these worksheets you&rsquo;ll be asked to practice various concepts with a provided dataset. These worksheets will contain a mix of problems ranging from easy to very hard. The goal is not perfect completion of a worksheet and there isn&rsquo;t an answer key that I&rsquo;ll grade from. Rather, the goal here is to <em>practice the methodology at hand.</em> It&rsquo;s one thing to read about the methodology and read the documentation for the associated R packages, but it&rsquo;s another thing to actually apply that methodology to historical sources and ask questions of it. So, in other words, the goal of these worksheets is twofold. First, it is to grasp the basic programming concepts related to the methodology. Second, it is to understand what types of historical questions can be asked of that method and what kinds of arguments or interpretations it makes possible. There are a total of seven worksheets across the semester. They are listed in the schedule on the day they are due. Note that in all cases they are due <strong>before the start of class</strong> as we will discuss and go over them together.
<ul>
<li>#1: R Basics - January 31st at 4:30pm</li>
<li>#2: Data Structures - due February 14th at 4:30pm</li>
<li>#3: Data Manipulation - due February 21st at 4:30pm</li>
<li>#4: Data Visualization - due February 28th at 4:30pm</li>
<li>#5: Mapping - due March 14th at 4:30pm</li>
<li>#6: Text Analysis - due April 4th at 4:30pm</li>
<li>#7: Topic Modeling - due April 11th at 4:30pm</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Dataset Biography (20%):</strong> Each of you will create a Dataset Biography during the semester. Creating a historical dataset is a process that is fraught with decisions that impact how the dataset can be used. This assignment asks you to think about and document the process of collecting information from primary sources and turning it into data. Using primary sources of your choosing (I can provide suggestions if you need them), your data management plan should come up with a data structure and define key elements of the dataset. What is the dataset based on? What information will be captured and how will it be stored? Will you be importing external data? (i.e. Historical place names from an existing dataset or information about a person&rsquo;s term in office.) If so, where will that information come from? Who owns it? What are the methods behind the data collection design and process?</li>
<li><strong>Historical Dataset Review (10%):</strong> For most weeks during the semester one student will give a short presentation on a historical dataset. Much like a book review in a traditional historical seminar, this dataset review should interrogate the methods used to create the dataset. A handout will be provided in class, but your review should ask questions like: Are the data logically and consistently organized? What primary sources is the dataset based on? What is added and what is missing? Was the data processed? Are they layers of scholarly interpretation integrated into the dataset? What digital scholarly products have been produced using this dataset? How does the dataset shape the interpretation that the authors were able to reach? You&rsquo;ll sign up for a date and a dataset in the first weeks of class. I&rsquo;ll provide a list of suggestions, however, if you have a dataset that you&rsquo;d like to review and isn&rsquo;t on my list email me to discuss the potential of including it.</li>
<li><strong>Final Project</strong> Data Driven Historical Vignette (30%) - At the conclusion of the course you will demonstrate the skills you have learned by writing a data driven historical vignette. This vignette can use a dataset provided for class or one of your own creation, but it will use data visualizations and analysis to make a historical argument about the data. It should blend prose and visualization in a .Rmd document and include citations to other scholarship where necessary. It should be no longer than 1500 words.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Grading Scale:</strong> A (93-100), A- (90–92), B+ (87–89), B (83–86), B- (80–82), C+ (77–79), C (73–76), C- (70–72).</p>

<h3 id="policies--procedures">Policies &amp; Procedures</h3>
<p><em>Please note that this syllabus may be updated online as necessary. The online version of this syllabus is the only authoritative version.</em></p>
<h5 id="late-work">Late Work</h5>
<p>Due dates for all assignments are listed on the course syllabus and in the schedule for the class. Because of the technical nature of this class it is <strong>essential</strong> that you keep up with the worksheets. If you miss one worksheet the others will be much harder because you will have missed key concepts. Unless otherwise stated, assignments are due on the day listed on the syllabus and canvas. If you submit an assignment late, I will deduct 10% for every day that it is late. Assignments submitted more than 7 days after the due date will not be accepted.</p>
<h5 id="classroom-conduct">Classroom Conduct</h5>
<p>In order to learn, we must be open to the views of people different from ourselves. In the time we share together over the semester, please honor the uniqueness of your fellow classmates and appreciate the opportunity we have to learn from one another. Please respect each others’ opinions and refrain from personal attacks or demeaning comments of any kind. Anyone who engages in hostile or antagonistic rhetoric will be asked to leave the classroom immediately.</p>

<li><a href="https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html">R</a> (There are many locations that host or mirror the package and make it available for download. Just choose a CRAN mirror that is nearby and don&rsquo;t worry too much about this.)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.rstudio.com/">R Studio.</a></li>
<li><a href="https://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a> (only if you have a mac).</li>
