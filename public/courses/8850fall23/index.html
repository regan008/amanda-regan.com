<ul>
<li><strong>Berks Summary:</strong> This summer we will attend the Berkshire Women’s History Conference. During the conference you should attend sessions, introduce yourself to scholars and other graduate students, and visit the exhibition hall. While you network in these spaces, ask people what they think the most significant development in the field has been in the last 10-15 years. Where is the field going?
<ul>
<li>When you return, in a 2-4 page paper, summarize your experience at the Berkshire Conference. Based on the panels you went to and the scholars you met, what direction is the field of Women’s History going in? What were the major conversations and themes that emerged from the panels you attended take place at these panels.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>THOMAS Entries and Discussions:</strong> We will meet every other Friday to discuss the readings. By 11:59pm the night before, you should upload a <a href="../../resources/notes-template">THOMAS entry</a> for that week’s readings and be prepared to discuss them in our meeting.</li>
<li><strong>Digital History Syllabus Draft:</strong> Part of your Portfolio will include a syllabus in digital history. Since you are attending 3180 this semester which is a women’s history course taught with a significant emphasis on digital history, this is a great time for you to think about what such a course might look like for you. The final project for this independent study is to write a digital history syllabus. It should be for an upper-division (3-4000 level) digital history course based on a historical theme. You must annotate at least six weeks of the syllabus for this assignment. At the end of the semester, I will provide feedback and then you should annotate the remainder of the syllabus in preparation for your portfolio. For details on what an annotated syllabi should look like and contain <a href="/resources/annotated-syllabi-guidelines/">see my guidelines here.</a></li>
