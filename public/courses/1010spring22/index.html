<p>In this course we will explore American history beginning with the initial settlement of the continent and ending with the Civil War. Rather than covering every detail and event within this period, the course will focus on providing a broad overview of how the United States came to be, the major forces shaping its development, and the significance of Colonial America. Students will leave this class with a basic understanding of the major turning points and events in American History to 1865 and will study how political, economic, social, intellectual, cultural, and religious changes shaped the development of the early United States.</p>

<h5 id="covid-19">COVID-19</h5>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has been a challenge for everyone and we will need to continue to deal with it throughout the Spring semester. Our class is scheduled to be fully in person in Spring 2022.</p>
<p>Clemson has a mask mandate. You must wear a mask over your nose and mouth at all times when in university buildings and that includes during our class. If you need a mask, a box will be available in the classroom.</p>
<p>Our class will take place not only in the middle of a global pandemic but also in the midst of yet another rise in COVID-19 cases due to the delta and omicron variants. There is a possibility some of you may miss class due to isolation/quarantine or illness. Please know that I want you to succeed in this course and I will make every possible accommodation should you need to miss class due to a pandemic related issue. In order to be flexible as circumstances surrounding the pandemic continue to evolve, we will deal with potential absences, make up assignments, and other exceptions or accommodations on a case-by-case basis as we need to.</p>
<p>It is <strong>very important</strong> that if you do need to miss class for any amount of time due to isolation/quarantine, illness, or another reason that you let me know using the <a href="https://noa.app.clemson.edu/login/sign-in.php">notification of absences module</a> on the Clemson University website.</p>

<br>


<ul>
<li><strong>Quizzes &amp; Participation (10%):</strong> This category encompasses <em>both</em> quizzes and attendance.
<ul>
<li><em>Quizzes:</em> Each week you will have a short quiz based on the weeks assigned reading. These quizzes will be open notes and open book and you will complete them in Canvas. Each week, except where noted, the quiz will open on Friday and it is due by 11:59pm on Thursday.</li>
<li><em>Participation:</em> Our time in class is the opportunity to actively engage with the material we are exploring. Participation during class is crucial because it is an important avenue for learning. I encourage you to be active in every class session. This participation grade serves as a way to credit you with the effort and work you are putting into the class in and out of the classroom. However, I understand that we all have different levels of comfort regarding speaking in class. Participation can take numerous forms such as speaking to the whole group, working in smaller groups during class, and completing in-class activities.</li>
<li>Although attendance is not formally graded, it is crucial to earning a good participation grade. You can only participate fully if you are in regular attendance and you cannot pass this class without coming to class regularly. That being said, we are in the midst of a pandemic and <strong><em>I do not want students who feel ill to come to class</em></strong>. If you any symptoms at all, please <strong>DO NOT</strong> come to class and get in contact with me to schedule make up work. <strong>You will not be penalized for missing class due to illness.</strong> If you do need to miss class I ask that you please report your absence through the university’s <a href="https://noa.app.clemson.edu/login/sign-in.php">notification of absences module</a>. This helps the office of Student Advocacy track and identify students who may need extra help and it sends me an official notice of your absence.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Document Analysis Worksheets (5 @ 5% = 25%):</strong> Over the course of the semester you will complete 5 document analysis worksheets. This assignment is designed to help you learn to think historically and analyze the primary sources that we will read over the course of this semester. Worksheets should be typed using the template provided and turned in <strong>before the start of class</strong> the day that document is assigned. In class you&rsquo;ll sign up to complete your document analyses on five different days over the course of the semester. Please note that for pedagogical reasons these assignments are due <em>before</em> the class session where we discuss it. The document analysis worksheet is available on Canvas or you can <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/2nf8e05zsbp48oy/Document%20Analysis%20Worksheet.docx?dl=1">click here to download it.</a> These worksheets are each worth 5% of your grade for a total of 25%.</li>
<li><strong>Midterm Examination (25%):</strong> Our midterm will be a take home exam. It is open book and open note but must be completed individually. It will take place Thursday March 17th and more details will be provided closer to the exam. The midterm exam is worth 25% of your grade.</li>
<li><strong>Timeline Assignment (20%):</strong> You will create an interactive online Timeline that consists of important developments in American history to 1877. We will learn how to build timelines in <a href="http://timeline.knightlab.com">Timeline.js</a> together in class and your timeline will be due on the day of our final exam. For section 3, it is due Monday, May 2nd by 11:59pm. For section 4, it is due Friday, May 6th by 11:59pm. Although this assignment isn&rsquo;t due until the end of the semester, the content on your timeline should be cumulative. In other words, you should not wait until the last minute and only include events from the last few weeks of class. The timeline is worth 20% of your grade and further details will be provided in a handout.</li>
<li><strong>Essay (20%):</strong> You will also write one short essay on one of the two required books. You must read both books however you may choose which book you&rsquo;d like to write on and prompts will be provided for both. If you choose to write on <em>Never Caught</em> essays will be due Thursday March 31st by 11:59pm. If you choose to write on <em>Apostles of Disunion</em> your essay will be due Tuesday, April 26th by 11:59pm. In class you&rsquo;ll sign up to write on one of these two books. This essay is worth 20% of your grade.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="grading-system">Grading System</h5>
<p>Final grades will follow Clemson&rsquo;s percentage-based grading scale. Please note that I will round up <em>only</em>  if you fall within .5% of the next grade up. So, for example, I will round up a grade that is a 89.51% or higher. Please do not ask me to round your grade up if you don&rsquo;t fall within that range.</p>
<ul>
<li>A: 90-100%</li>
<li>B: 80-90%</li>
<li>C: 70-79%</li>
<li>D: 60-69%</li>
<li>F: 0-59%</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 id="policies--procedures">Policies &amp; Procedures</h3>
<p><em>Please note that this syllabus may be updated online as necessary. The online version of this syllabus is the only authoritative version.</em></p>
<h5 id="required-purchases">Required Purchases</h5>
<p>There are three required texts for this course. Our textbook <em>The American Yawp</em> is an open and freely accessible online textbook. However, if you would prefer a printed copy you can purchase one through the bookstore or a bookseller of your choice. Our other two texts <em>Never Caught: The Washingtons&rsquo; Relentless Pursuit of Their Runaway Slave, Ona Judge</em> by Erica Armstrong Dunbar and <em>Apostles of Disunion: Southern Secession Commissioners and the Causes of the Civil War</em> by Charles B. Dew need to be purchased in hardcopy (or e-book) form. If you are struggling to afford your book purchases please talk to me privately. All other readings will be available for free online.</p>
<h5 id="late-work">Late Work</h5>
<p>Many of our assignments are due on a rolling basis to allow for flexibility. The only assignments that do not fit this category are the midterm exam, the timeline assignment, and the quizzes. These assignments need to be completed on time unless you have an emergency. For late quizzes, document analyses, essays, or timelines I will deduct 10% for every day it is late. The midterm cannot be made up unless you have received a documented extension from me <em>ahead</em> of the exam.</p>
<p><strong>Extensions:</strong> Shit happens &ndash; and I get that. We&rsquo;re in the middle of a pandemic, life is stressful, and I believe in flexibility. Therefore, if you need an extension on an assignment just ask. For most assignments, I&rsquo;m more than likely to grant it. My only criteria is that you ask <strong>ahead</strong> of the due date. You can exercise the extension clause once during the semester. If you are out with COVID for an extended period and need to miss an assignment, we&rsquo;ll make special arrangements catered to your circumstances.</p>
<h5 id="technology-in-class">Technology in Class</h5>
<p>You are welcome to use a personal device such as a laptop, phone, or tablet to take notes during class. You may find it useful to have the course readings accessible during class. However, if the device becomes a distraction and you are doing other things on it I will ask you to take notes by hand instead.</p>
<p>In at least one class session we&rsquo;ll use an online tool to learn to make timelines. You&rsquo;ll need a laptop or tablet for this class however if you don&rsquo;t have access to one talk to me before class and we&rsquo;ll set you up with a rental from the library.</p>
<p>A note on laptops for taking notes. While you are welcome to use your laptop to take notes in class, I would encourage you not to do so. Studies have found that students who take notes by hand are better able to conceptually recall information later compared to those who typed notes. During class you may want to use your laptop to open the lecture slides at your desk, pull up the readings, etc but I&rsquo;d encourage you to refrain from using your laptop to type notes.</p>
<h5 id="classroom-conduct">Classroom Conduct</h5>
<p>In order to learn, we must be open to the views of people different from ourselves. In the time we share together over the semester, please honor the uniqueness of your fellow classmates and appreciate the opportunity we have to learn from one another. Please respect each others’ opinions and refrain from personal attacks or demeaning comments of any kind. Anyone who engages in hostile or antagonistic rhetoric will be asked to leave the classroom immediately.</p>
<h5 id="academic-integrity">Academic Integrity</h5>
<p>As members of the Clemson University community, we have inherited Thomas Green Clemson&rsquo;s vision of this institution as a &ldquo;high seminary of learning.&rdquo; Fundamental to this vision is a mutual commitment to truthfulness, honor, and responsibility, without which we cannot earn the trust and respect of others. Furthermore, we recognize that academic dishonesty detracts from the value of a Clemson degree. Therefore, we shall not tolerate lying, cheating, or stealing in any form.</p>
<p>All infractions of academic dishonesty by undergraduates must be reported to Undergraduate Studies for resolution through that office. In cases of plagiarism instructors may use the Plagiarism Resolution Form.</p>
<p>See the <a href="https://www.clemson.edu/academics/integrity/">Undergraduate Academic Integrity Policy</a> website for additional information and the <a href="https://catalog.clemson.edu/index.php?catoid=33">current catalogue</a> for the policy.</p>
<p>Please keep in mind that if you are copying and pasting text that you did not write yourself, you might be plagiarizing. If you are using copied text, whether pasted or retyped manually, you must be sure to accurately cite the information. Text is accurately cited when: 1) pasted text is surrounded by quotation marks or offset as a block quote and 2) the pasted text is attributed to its author and source and 3) the pasted text is cited in a footnote, endnote, or bibliography.</p>
<h5 id="student-accessibility-services">Student Accessibility Services</h5>
<p>Clemson University values the diversity of our student body as a strength and a critical component of our dynamic community. Students with disabilities or temporary injuries/conditions may require accommodations due to barriers in the structure of facilities, course design, technology used for curricular purposes, or other campus resources. Students who experience a barrier to full access to this class should let the instructor know and make an appointment to meet with a staff member in Student Accessibility Services as soon as possible. You can make an appointment by calling 864-656-6848, by emailing <a href="mailto:studentaccess@lists.clemson.edu">studentaccess@lists.clemson.edu</a>, or by visiting Suite 239 in the Academic Success Center building. Appointments are strongly encouraged – drop-ins will be seen if at all possible, but there could be a significant wait due to scheduled appointments.  Students who have accommodations are strongly encouraged to request, obtain and send these to their instructors through their AIM portal as early in the semester as possible so that accommodations can be made in a timely manner. It is the student’s responsibility to follow this process each semester.<br>
