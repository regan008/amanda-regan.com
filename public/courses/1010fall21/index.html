    <h2 id="course-description">Course Description</h2>
<p>History 1010 covers the political, economic, and social development of the American people from the period of discovery to the end of Reconstruction. Includes Honors sections.</p>
<h2 id="course-overview">Course Overview</h2>
<p>In this course we will explore American history beginning with the initial settlement of the continent and ending with the Civil War. Rather than covering every detail and event within this period, the course will focus on providing a broad overview of how the United States came to be, the major forces shaping its development, and the significance of Colonial America. Students will leave this class with a basic understanding of the major turning points and events in American History to 1865 and will study how political, economic, social, intellectual, cultural, and religious changes shaped the development of the early United States.</p>
<h2 id="learning-objectives">Learning Objectives:</h2>
<p>Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Explain the major historical events and turning points of American history and government before 1865.</li>
<li>Explain the changing geo-political structures of the United States up until 1865.</li>
<li>Define the importance of key individuals and developments in American history before 1865.</li>
<li>Identify the social, economic, and political forces at work in the evolution of early American history.</li>
<li>Recognize and describe the significance of some of the cultural achievements of American history.</li>
<li>Analyze complex historical sources and materials and reach conclusions based on interpretations of those materials.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>South Carolina REACH Act:</strong></p>
<p>This course fulfills the requirements of South Carolina’s “Reinforcing College Education of America’s Constitutional Heritage Act (REACH) Act” of April 28, 2021. The course will provide a comprehensive overview of the major events and turning points in American History and government and students will read key documents related to American history. These documents include but are not not limited to: the American Constitution, the Declaration of Independence, the Emancipation Proclamation, at least five of the Federalist Papers, and document(s)related to the African American Freedom struggle. Readings that fulfill this requirement are noted in the syllabus schedule.</p>
<h2 id="covid-19">COVID-19</h2>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has been a challenge for everyone and we will need to continue to deal with it throughout the Fall semester. Our class is scheduled to be fully in person in Fall 2021.</p>
<p>I would strongly strongly encourage you to wear a mask during class regardless of whether or not you are vaccinated. We must work together to keep our fellow tigers safe and to ensure that those who are most at risk and vulnerable are safe during this time. I will be wearing a mask during class and I hope you will join me in doing so.</p>
<p>Because we&rsquo;re in the middle of a global pandemic and a rise in COVID-19 cases due to the delta variant there is a possibility some of you may miss class due to isolation/quarantine or illness. Please know that I want you to succeed in this course and I will make every possible accommodation should you need to miss class due to a pandemic related issue. In order to be flexible as circumstances surrounding the pandemic continue to evolve, we will deal with potential absences, make up assignments, and other exceptions or accommodations on a case-by-case basis as we need to.</p>
<p>Please note that it is <strong>very important</strong> that if you do need to miss class for any amount of time due to isolation/quarantine, illness, or another reason that you let me know using the <a href="https://noa.app.clemson.edu/login/sign-in.php">notification of absences module</a> on the Clemson University website.</p>

<br>


<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Quizzes:</strong> During most class sessions you will complete a short quiz through Canvas. The quiz will open at the start of class and you will have 10 minutes to complete the quiz. These quizzes must be completed in class and cannot be made up due to missing class unless you have a documented absence that you have spoken with me about. These quizzes are worth 5% of your grade and your lowest 2 grades will be dropped.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Document Analysis Worksheets:</strong> Over the course of the semester you will complete 5 document analysis worksheets. This assignment is designed to help you learn to think historically and analyze the primary sources that we will read over the course of this semester. Worksheets should be typed using the template provided and turned in <strong>30 minutes before the start of class</strong> the day that document is assigned. In class you&rsquo;ll sign up to complete your document analyses on five different days over the course of the semester. The document analysis worksheet is available on Canvas or you can <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/2nf8e05zsbp48oy/Document%20Analysis%20Worksheet.docx?dl=1">click here to download it.</a>These worksheets are each worth 5% of your grade for a total of 25%.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Take Home Midterm:</strong> Our midterm will be a take home exam. It is open book and open note but must be completed individually. The exam prompt will be distributed Thursday October 7th and you will have until Thursday, October 14th at 11:59pm to complete the exam and turn it in via Canvas. A study guide will be provided about a week in advance. The exam will consist of short answer identification questions and an essay. The midterm exam is worth 30% of your grade.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Timeline Assignment:</strong> You will create an interactive online Timeline that consists of important developments in American history to 1877. We will learn how to build timelines in <a href="http://timeline.knightlab.com">Timeline.js</a> together in class and your timeline will be due on the day of our final exam, December 8th by 10:30am. Although this assignment isn&rsquo;t due until the end of the semester, the content on your timeline should be cumulative. In other words, you should not wait until the last minute and only include events from the last few weeks of class. The timeline is worth 20% of your grade and further details will be provided in a handout.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Essay:</strong> You will also write one short essay on one of the two required books. You must read both books however you may choose which book you&rsquo;d like to write on and prompts will be provided for both. If you choose to write on <em>Never Caught</em> essays will be due the start of class on October 28th. If you choose to write on <em>Apostles of Disunion</em> your essay will be due December 2nd by the start of class. In class you&rsquo;ll sign up to write on one of these two books. This essay is worth 20% of your grade.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Attendance:</strong> Attendance is not a graded component of your grade. However while attendance is not strictly graded, I would encourage you to attend class regularly as material that is discussed in class is often not included in the textbook and quizzes cannot be made up. There is a strong correlation between doing well in this class and attendance. Of course extenuating circumstances will sometimes make attending class impossible and if you do need to miss class I ask that you please report your absence through the university&rsquo;s <a href="https://noa.app.clemson.edu/login/sign-in.php">notification of absences module</a>.</p>
</li>

<h5 id="late-work">Late Work</h5>
<p>Many of our assignments are due on a rolling basis to allow for flexibility. The only assignments that do not fit this category are the midterm exam, the timeline assignment, and the quizzes. These assignments need to be completed on time unless you have an emergency. Late assignments will not be accepted and missed quizzes or exams cannot be made up without a documented emergency or legitimate reason. If you think you may miss any of these assignments or have an emergency please talk to me as soon as possible.</p>
<h5 id="technology-in-class">Technology in Class</h5>
<p>You are welcome to use a personal device such as a laptop, phone, or tablet to take notes during class. You may find it useful to have the course readings accessible during class. However, if the device becomes a distraction and you are doing other things on it I will ask you to take notes by hand instead.</p>
<p>In at least one class session we&rsquo;ll use an online tool to learn to make timelines. You&rsquo;ll need a laptop or tablet for this class however if you don&rsquo;t have access to one talk to me before class and we&rsquo;ll set you up with a rental from the library.</p>
<h5 id="classroom-conduct">Classroom Conduct</h5>
<p>In order to learn, we must be open to the views of people different from ourselves. In this time we share together over the semester, please honor the uniqueness of your fellow classmates and appreciate the opportunity we have to learn from one another. Please respect each others’ opinions and refrain from personal attacks or demeaning comments of any kind. Anyone who engages in hostile or antagonistic rhetoric will be asked to leave the classroom immediately.</p>
<h5 id="academic-integrity">Academic Integrity</h5>
<p>As members of the Clemson University community, we have inherited Thomas Green Clemson&rsquo;s vision of this institution as a &ldquo;high seminary of learning.&rdquo; Fundamental to this vision is a mutual commitment to truthfulness, honor, and responsibility, without which we cannot earn the trust and respect of others. Furthermore, we recognize that academic dishonesty detracts from the value of a Clemson degree. Therefore, we shall not tolerate lying, cheating, or stealing in any form.</p>
<p>All infractions of academic dishonesty by undergraduates must be reported to Undergraduate Studies for resolution through that office. In cases of plagiarism instructors may use the Plagiarism Resolution Form.</p>
<p>See the <a href="https://www.clemson.edu/academics/integrity/">Undergraduate Academic Integrity Policy</a> website for additional information and the <a href="https://catalog.clemson.edu/index.php?catoid=33">current catalogue</a> for the policy.</p>
<p>Please keep in mind that if you are copying and pasting text that you did not write yourself, you might be plagiarizing. If you are using copied text, whether pasted or retyped manually, you must be sure to accurately cite the information. Text is accurately cited when: 1) pasted text is surrounded by quotation marks or offset as a block quote and 2) the pasted text is attributed to its author and source and 3) the pasted text is cited in a footnote, endnote, or bibliography.</p>
<h5 id="student-accessibility-services">Student Accessibility Services</h5>
<p>Clemson University values the diversity of our student body as a strength and a critical component of our dynamic community. Students with disabilities or temporary injuries/conditions may require accommodations due to barriers in the structure of facilities, course design, technology used for curricular purposes, or other campus resources. Students who experience a barrier to full access to this class should let the instructor know and make an appointment to meet with a staff member in Student Accessibility Services as soon as possible. You can make an appointment by calling 864-656-6848, by emailing <a href="mailto:studentaccess@lists.clemson.edu">studentaccess@lists.clemson.edu</a>, or by visiting Suite 239 in the Academic Success Center building. Appointments are strongly encouraged – drop-ins will be seen if at all possible, but there could be a significant wait due to scheduled appointments.  Students who have accommodations are strongly encouraged to request, obtain and send these to their instructors through their AIM portal as early in the semester as possible so that accommodations can be made in a timely manner. It is the student’s responsibility to follow this process each semester.<br>
