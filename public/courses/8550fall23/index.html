    <h3 id="course-overview">Course Overview</h3>
<p>History 8550 is a seminar in digital history where students will create a piece of digital scholarship that uses digital history methods to advance a historical argument. Students will work in collaboration with the course instructor and their primary advisor to come up with a project that uses digital methods to advance a historiographical interpretation. Unlike a traditional seminar paper, this paper will likely have multiple components (a dataset, narrative writing piece, and code).</p>
<p>The format of this final project may differ depending on the methods and sources that you use for your project. While not required, many students will build on projects, code, or ideas developed in History 8510. Regardless of the platform you choose to work in, all students will create a documented dataset based on primary source research and use digital methods to analyze it. The resulting article length paper (or project text, if appropriate) will be between 7,500 and 10,000 words.</p>
<h5 id="learning-objectives">Learning Objectives:</h5>
<p>By the end of this course, student will be familiar with the key methods and challenges in building a digital history project. Students will leave this course able to propose, develop, document, and build a digital history project based on original primary source research. They will also be able to use these digital methods to advance a historiographical argument.</p>

</table>


<br>


<ul>
<li><strong>Research Proposal/Grant Application (25%):</strong> The research proposal/grant application should consist of a project narrative, workplan, and a set of deliverables. It should follow the examples and guidelines set by the National Endowment for the Humanities. For links to each of the NEH&rsquo;s programs and further details see the assignment directions on canvas.</li>
<li><strong>Digital History Project and Paper (50%):</strong> The format and platform for your project may differ depending on your topic so many of the details for this assignment will be worked out on an indivudal basis between the student and instructor. But in general there will be several components to this project:
<ul>
<li><strong>Dataset</strong> - every student will have some form of a dataset. Every dataset must have a written discussion of methodology in the format of a data biography. In most cases the data should be hosted in its own repository on github. If necessary, this dataset can be private.</li>
<li><strong>Code</strong> - Many projects will have code that accompanies the project. Whether for data manipulation purposes (something like geocoding or ocr), or for data analysis (text analysis, mapping etc) a github repository for the project should be created and code should be commented with descriptive transparent commentary about the methods being used. Code should be reproducible and open access unless there are ethical or copyright concerns.</li>
<li><strong>Written Component</strong> - Every student must write a seminar style paper based on their work. In some cases data and code will be integrated into the article itself in the style of articles from the <em>Journal of Digital Histroy</em>. Others, such as those working in GIS or with an extensive relational database, may need to include screenshots or links in their paper. The format will be worked out in consultation with the instructor on an individual basis, but in general the written component should be between 8,000 and 10,000 words.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Class Participation, Peer Reviews, and other written work (25%):</strong> Throughout the class you will have small chunks of writing, drafts, and peer reviews due. These milestones are outlined in the schedule and all assignments should be posted to canvas and to slack where noted in the schedule.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="grading-system">Grading System</h5>
<p>Final grades will follow Clemson&rsquo;s percentage-based grading scale. Please note that I will round up <em>only</em> if you fall within .5% of the next grade up. So, for example, I will round up a grade that is a 89.51% or higher. Please do not ask me to round your grade up if you don&rsquo;t fall within that range.</p>
<ul>
<li>A: 90-100%</li>
<li>B: 80-90%</li>
<li>C: 70-79%</li>
<li>D: 60-69%</li>
<li>F: 0-59%</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 id="policies--procedures">Policies &amp; Procedures</h3>
<p><em>Please note that this syllabus may be updated online as necessary. The online version of this syllabus is the only authoritative version.</em></p>
<h5 id="late-work">Late Work</h5>
<p>Due dates for all assignments are listed on the course syllabus and in the schedule for the class. No late work will be accepted. Many of the milestones and due dates for this class are scaffolded in order to help you be succesful and complete the final project. Therefore, it is <strong>essential</strong> that work is turned in on time and that you stay up to date with the work in class.</p>
<h5 id="classroom-conduct">Classroom Conduct</h5>
<p>In order to learn, we must be open to the views of people different from ourselves. In the time we share together over the semester, please honor the uniqueness of your fellow classmates and appreciate the opportunity we have to learn from one another. Please respect each others’ opinions and refrain from personal attacks or demeaning comments of any kind. Anyone who engages in hostile or antagonistic rhetoric will be asked to leave the classroom immediately.</p>
<h5 id="academic-integrity">Academic Integrity</h5>
<p>As members of the Clemson University community, we have inherited Thomas Green Clemson&rsquo;s vision of this institution as a &ldquo;high seminary of learning.&rdquo; Fundamental to this vision is a mutual commitment to truthfulness, honor, and responsibility, without which we cannot earn the trust and respect of others. Furthermore, we recognize that academic dishonesty detracts from the value of a Clemson degree. Therefore, we shall not tolerate lying, cheating, or stealing in any form.</p>
<p>All infractions of academic dishonesty by undergraduates must be reported to Undergraduate Studies for resolution through that office. In cases of plagiarism instructors may use the Plagiarism Resolution Form.</p>
<p>See the <a href="https://www.clemson.edu/academics/integrity/">Undergraduate Academic Integrity Policy</a> website for additional information and the <a href="https://catalog.clemson.edu/index.php?catoid=33">current catalogue</a> for the policy.</p>
<p>Please keep in mind that if you are copying and pasting text that you did not write yourself, you might be plagiarizing. If you are using copied text, whether pasted or retyped manually, you must be sure to accurately cite the information. Text is accurately cited when: 1) pasted text is surrounded by quotation marks or offset as a block quote and 2) the pasted text is attributed to its author and source and 3) the pasted text is cited in a footnote, endnote, or bibliography.</p>
<h5 id="student-accessibility-services">Student Accessibility Services</h5>
<p>Clemson University values the diversity of our student body as a strength and a critical component of our dynamic community. Students with disabilities or temporary injuries/conditions may require accommodations due to barriers in the structure of facilities, course design, technology used for curricular purposes, or other campus resources. Students who experience a barrier to full access to this class should let the instructor know and make an appointment to meet with a staff member in Student Accessibility Services as soon as possible. You can make an appointment by calling 864-656-6848, by emailing <a href="mailto:studentaccess@lists.clemson.edu">studentaccess@lists.clemson.edu</a>, or by visiting Suite 239 in the Academic Success Center building. Appointments are strongly encouraged – drop-ins will be seen if at all possible, but there could be a significant wait due to scheduled appointments.  Students who have accommodations are strongly encouraged to request, obtain and send these to their instructors through their AIM portal as early in the semester as possible so that accommodations can be made in a timely manner. It is the student’s responsibility to follow this process each semester.<br>
You can access further information at the <a href="https://www.clemson.edu/academics/studentaccess/index.html">Student Accessibility website</a>.  Other information is at the university’s <a href="https://www.clemson.edu/accessibility/access/accommodations-services.html">Accessibility Portal.</a></p>
<h5 id="commitment-to-diversity">Commitment to Diversity</h5>
