      <description>&lt;p&gt;The last couple weeks we&amp;rsquo;ve been reading about color and the do&amp;rsquo;s and don&amp;rsquo;ts of picking a color scheme. I think the reading in &lt;em&gt;White Space is Not Your Enemy&lt;/em&gt; was very helpful and got me thinking about the color scheme for the design project.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Something that was extremely useful for me was the explanation of the differences between CMYK, PANTONE, and RGB. Prior to reading this I sort of understood the difference just from experience but the reading really pinpointed what each system is for, when to use it, and how it works. I think understanding how color is generated on a screen will factor into how I choose color schemes and design my final project.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The final version of my Clio Wired Project, &lt;a href=&#34;www.amanda-regan.com/cliof13&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Shifts in Physical Culture,&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; is online now. It has been quite the process getting everything formatted correctly&amp;ndash;I realized after I presented that I had made a mistake and did not included all of the articles when I ran the topic modeling software so I had to adjust that. Overall the results are the same&amp;ndash;there is a definite change in the discussion of physical culture between 1932 and 1937.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Shifts in Physical Culture: A Textual Analysis</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/shifts-physical-culture-textual-analysis/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My work of digital scholarship uses Topic Modeling to analyze a set of articles written by Sylvia Ullback, a beauty expert in the 1930s, between 1932 and 1937.  Ullback&amp;rsquo;s articles shift during this period and the change in her discussion of beauty can be seen in the topic models.  For more background on Sylvia Ullback and her career see &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amanda-regan.com/cliof13&#34;&gt;the website for this project&lt;/a&gt;.  This is a work in progress and I&amp;rsquo;ll give more detail about the changes tonight in class but here is what I have so far:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Digital Humanities and Collaboration</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Collaboration isn’t new for historians.  A piece of historical scholarship has always involved a range of people.  The prologue of most traditional monographs includes a list of those who helped make the book possible.  From the support and assistance of archivists and librarians, to review and support by fellow scholars and students, and often financial support from institutions and publishers publishing a work of traditional scholarship is by no means an individual endeavor.  However, traditional works of scholarship are not typically described as collaborative.  Digital Technology allows and requires collaboration in two, more visible, ways.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Technology and the Classroom</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I TA’d for the first time last spring, my last semester in my masters program.  It was the first time I had ever taught and I quickly learned that leading a discussion section and getting freshman interested in World History was challenging.  I came away from the semester realizing, what may be obvious to those more experienced teachers, that teaching history to undergrads from a variety of majors is more difficult that it appears.  I think a large part of the challenge with my class was dealing with English Language Learners.  It took me about three-quarters of the semester to realize that it wasn’t that the students weren’t reading, it was that they had trouble reading documents written in the ancient world.  Many of them didn’t bring this to my attention, but as the semester progressed I began to realize that they were having trouble reading and understanding documents from Ancient Egypt or Mesopotamia so discussing them became even more difficult.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Big Data for Historians</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/big-data-historians/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Franco Moretti’s article “Graphs, Maps, and Trees: Abstract Models for Literary History,” shows how most histories of the book have focused on a few particular books rather than the novel as a genre.  This has probably had to do with scale.  It would be an overwhelming and almost impossible task to read every single novel in order to write a comprehensive and all-encompassing history of the novel.  However, this is where Big Data allows historians to look at large trends in ways that are impractical without computers.  Moretti shows how the history of the novel can be looked at numerically and graphically using big data techniques.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Mapping Regional Ideals of Beauty, 1900-1940: A Digital Research Resouce</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As I&amp;rsquo;ve mentioned a few times before I am interested in ideas about the body and beauty in the early twentieth century.  My digital resource is a research tool that would help me to analyze the mass amounts of newspaper articles available.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Between 1900 and 1940 there were several distinct shifts in the ideas of beauty and physical culture for women in the United States.  Shifts in the image and role of the New Woman, from the Gibson Girl to the Flapper, were accompanied by changes in the ideal female body.  The 1920s were dominated by a “Reducing Craze” which gave way in the late 1920s to a more sensible and health based routine of diet and exercise.  This model of physical culture lasted throughout most of the 1930s but began to decline, for reasons that are complex, in the late 1930s.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Spatial History as a Research Tool</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/spatial-history-research-tool/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In Richard White&amp;rsquo;s article &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.stanford.edu/group/spatialhistory/cgi-bin/site/pub.php?id=29&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;What is Spatial History?,&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; he discusses the turn to spatial history and the ways in which it can be used as a research tool to enhance historical scholarship. His article was fascinating and really got me thinking about different spatial history projects I&amp;rsquo;ve seen. Two that come to mind is &lt;a href=&#34;http://dsl.richmond.edu/emancipation/&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Visualizing Emancipation&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;, run by Scott Nesbit and Edward Ayers at the University of Richmond&amp;rsquo;s Digital Scholarship Lab, and &lt;a href=&#34;http://users.humboldt.edu/mstephens/hate/hate_map.html&#34;&gt;The Geography of Hate&lt;/a&gt;, run by Monica Stephens at Humboldt State University. I also have been thinking about mapping for my own research and what that might look like and how it might enhance my research.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Examples of Spatial History</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I posted these in the Zotero group, but I thought I would add them here as well.  I think these are two interesting examples of spatial history.  &lt;a href=&#34;http://mappingdecline.lib.uiowa.edu/&#34;&gt;Mapping Decline: St. Louis and the American City&lt;/a&gt; is an example of using a spatial history component to bolster an argument.  We have been talking about Digital History and whether it needs to make an argument all semester and I think _Mapping Decline _is a great example of a project that does that.  &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mappingdubois.org/&#34;&gt;Mapping the Du Bois Philadelphia Negro&lt;/a&gt; is another example of a spatial history project which could, and I think is intended to be, a research tool.  The project doesn&amp;rsquo;t currently offer any analysis, but they do list several research questions they hope to answer on the home page.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>On the Overwhelming Challenge of Preserving Born Digital Materials</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/395/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.digitalpreservation.gov/documents/ndiipp_plan.pdf&#34;&gt;Preserving our Digital Heritage:&lt;/a&gt; Plan for the National Digital Information Infrastructure and Preservation Program stated that the average length of a website is 44 days. That really surprised me. I think the preservation of born digital material is an important issue right now, and it&amp;rsquo;s only going to get more important as our world increasingly becomes more digital. It is really an overwhelming issue with so many hurdles and potential issues.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Crowdsourced Collections: A Democratic Approach</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I came across a project of Berry College and Bloomsberg University this week called the &lt;a href=&#34;https://mbda.berry.edu&#34;&gt;Martha Berry Digital Archive&lt;/a&gt;.  The site is built on &lt;a href=&#34;http://omeka.org/&#34;&gt;Omeka &lt;/a&gt;and a plugin the developers created for the site called &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/gsbodine/crowd-ed&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Crowd-Ed&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;.  The plugin allows the digitization of their entire collection to be crowdsourced.  In other words, the archive digitizes the documents and users annotate, tag, and fill in the metadata for each item.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Crowdsourcing has been gaining popularity recently and has become a way for archives to digitize mass amounts of data fairly quickly and at a minimal cost.  The &lt;a href=&#34;http://transcribe.archives.gov/&#34;&gt;National Archives and Records Administration&lt;/a&gt; began doing this in January 2012 and have allowed users to transcribe, tag, and edit documents all online.  Later in 2012, the technology used by the National Archives was released as open-source.  The overwhelming popularity of crowdsourcing with the public has led many other archives to begin doing the same thing.  &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ancestry.com/&#34;&gt; Ancestry.com&lt;/a&gt; used it to transcribe the 1940 census (although then they charged for access to the census&amp;ndash;not cool).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Open Access, Open Source, and the Responsibilities of Historians in the Digital World</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I attended &lt;a href=&#34;http://2013.baltimore.wordcamp.org/&#34;&gt;WordCamp Baltimore&lt;/a&gt;, a WordPress developers conference.  &lt;a href=&#34;http://aaron.jorb.in/&#34;&gt;Aaron Jorbin&lt;/a&gt;, a well-known WordPress developer in the D.C. area, gave the keynote address which was about open source platforms and the open source community.  If you aren&amp;rsquo;t familiar with the &amp;ldquo;.org&amp;rdquo; version of WordPress, it is open source and free to anyone who wants to use, modify, or develop the software.  Jorbin&amp;rsquo;s keynote was entitled &amp;ldquo;Citizenship in the Open Source World&amp;rdquo; and he talked a lot about the responsibilities and the rights of a citizen in the &amp;ldquo;Open Source World.&amp;rdquo;  Jorbin argued that in the &amp;ldquo;Open Source World,&amp;rdquo; the free flow of information is crucial and as citizens we have the responsibility to share knowledge because open source is a team sport.  The freedoms of this world include the freedom to learn, to use, to change, and to distribute.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Webdesign for Academics </title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Web Design is not something academic are traditionally trained in.  However, as the discipline continues to change and Digital History continues to develop and grow, knowing a little bit about what constitutes a good historical website is necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Alexander Dawson makes excellent points about the development and organization of a website in his article &lt;a href=&#34;http://sixrevisions.com/usabilityaccessibility/improve-site-usability-by-studying-museums/&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Improve Usability by Studying Museums.&amp;rdquo; &lt;/a&gt; He compares the layout of a museum to that of a website and argues that many web designers could take some tips from the organization of museums.  Among these include creating a set of very clear navigational aids or bread crumbs for users as they navigate through the website, creating appropriate documentation such as help guides and FAQ&amp;rsquo;s for users, and featuring important or new items prominently on the front of the site.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;What are the digital humanities, what do they do, and how does digital history fit in? It’s a valid question and one that I think has several answers.&lt;a href=&#34;http://sites.library.northwestern.edu/dh/&#34;&gt;Northwestern University’s “A Guide to Digital Humanities”&lt;/a&gt;confronts this question and attempts to make sense of the many different definitions that exist for Digital Humanities. The consensus seems to be that the Digital Humanities are centered on scholarship.  The digital humanities are both a methodology and a presentation technique.  Building and using digital tools, presenting research in digital form, and critiquing and experimenting with digital technology are all within the field of Digital Humanities.  Digital History then aims to build tools that enhance historical research, make historical documents and records more accessible, and to present historical scholarship in digital form.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll be using this website as my blog for Clio I this fall at George Mason University.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am a PhD student and Digital History Fellow at George Mason University. My research interest is primarily U.S. Women’s history with a particular focus on physical culture and beauty in the early twentieth century as well as Digital History.  As part of the Digital History Fellowship I will be working in the Center for History and Media at GMU for the next few years.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
