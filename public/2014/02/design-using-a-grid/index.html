    <p>The reading for this week in _Thinking with Type _about grids was extremely interesting to me.  The section about tables and grids in html particularly peaked my interest.  I think the hardest part of html and css is learning layout but I think a grid makes the whole idea of layout easier to understand.  I&rsquo;ve always used grids when I code, particularly I like the <a href="http://960.gs">960 grid system</a> which makes layout very easy and allows you to work of a variety of grid layouts.</p>
<p>I think Lupton makes several good points about using grids for web design.  As she points out, a grid is essentially a set of rows and columns in a table.  After setting a table up within the code it can be used to define different elements on the page.  For example the navigation may take up 8 of the 12 columns while the logo takes up the other 4.  Lupton makes the important point however, that layout must be simple and designed to follow the user&rsquo;s eye.  Complicated layouts are not only a nuisance for accessibility but also tend to lose your user.</p>
<p>The pre-made grid systems that are available now make layout so much easier and there are a variety of them.  <a href="http://960.gs/">960</a> is a simple and straightforward grid that is defined in a css document and called using classes in the html document.  Others like <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Twitter&rsquo;s Bootstrap</a> and <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/">Zurb Foundation</a> are layout systems that also include a variety of elements such as navigation bars, buttons, search boxes etc.  However, there has been a lot of criticism of these layout systems as being very generic and giving many websites the same look and feel, especially Bootstrap.  I think that criticism may be true of Foundation and Bootstrap, but as I learned from Lupton this week, grids have been around since the 17th century as a crucial element of design.  The different layout packages and dimensions for the web may change but a grid layout, I think, is a staple in the designers toolbox that won&rsquo;t go away.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been starting to think about the Typography assignment and trying to decide what sort of grid I want to use.  I&rsquo;ve got a preliminary mock-up, but I&rsquo;m still playing with the alignment of my text (which right now is just latin).  I tend to be indecisive and change my mind sixteen times before I finally make a decision (normally because I&rsquo;m running out of time to keep playing with it).  The nice thing about using the grid though, is that if I do decide to change the layout it&rsquo;s very easy to do and I can spend my time focusing more on the design issues like font, color, and the various elements such as pull quotes.</p>
<p>This week I&rsquo;ve commented on: <a href="http://jannellelegg.com/?p=412#comment-56">Jannelle&rsquo;s Blog</a> and <a href="http://clio2garcia.wordpress.com/2014/02/16/if-you-build-it-make-them-come/comment-page-1/#comment-5">Beth&rsquo;s blog.</a></p>
