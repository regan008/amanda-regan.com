    <p>I&rsquo;ve been working on making some of the small changes to my <a href="http://www.amanda-regan.com/2014/02/22/typography-assignment/">typography project</a> that we discussed in class last week.  Most of the spacing fixes and the changes to the lines were super easy to fix but restoring the comic has taken a bit of time.  I played with doing different things to it, but the challenge with this particular image was that because it was printed from a microfilm reader (and then scanned) the image&rsquo;s quality is pretty poor even though the resolution is high.</p>
<p>First, I tried just adjusting the contrast and tone on the image which helped but what I really wanted to do was to remove the background.I tried using the quick selection tool to highlight just the section of the image I wanted and make a new layer from that but the image came out looking somewhat jagged and I wasn&rsquo;t happy with it.</p>

<p>Another idea I had for restoring the image involved using the live trace functionality of Illustrator. This seemed like a great idea in theory but I think the resulting image was lacking a lot of the playful character of the comic.</p>
<p>[caption id=&ldquo;attachment_620&rdquo; align=&ldquo;aligncenter&rdquo; width=&ldquo;150&rdquo;]<a href="http://www.amanda-regan.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/livetrace.jpg"><img src="http://www.amanda-regan.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/livetrace-150x150.jpg" alt="Image after Live tracing in Illustrator"></a> Image after Live tracing in Illustrator[/caption]</p>
<p>Next I decided to try to select all the grey parts of the image using the &ldquo;Select Color Range&rdquo; option.  Using this I was able to go through and select all the grey areas of the image.</p>
<p>[caption id=&ldquo;attachment_619&rdquo; align=&ldquo;alignright&rdquo; width=&ldquo;150&rdquo;]<a href="http://www.amanda-regan.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Screen-Shot-2014-03-28-at-2.45.50-PM.png"><img src="http://www.amanda-regan.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Screen-Shot-2014-03-28-at-2.45.50-PM-150x150.png" alt="Screenshot of the Select Color Range Menu"></a> Screenshot of the Select Color Range Menu[/caption]</p>
<p>After going through and selecting the grey I was able to delete it. I did this a few times and would come up with an image that was a bit more clear and not quite as dark.  I just had to clean up some of the remaining messy areas using the eraser tool.  The final product wasn&rsquo;t bad and since I have to reduce it so much to fit onto the site along with all of the other squares some of the small imperfections weren&rsquo;t noticeable. Here&rsquo;s the strip before and after my attempts at restoration.</p>
