I am a historian of the late-nineteenth and early twentieth-centuries. Currently, I am a Digital Humanities Postdoctoral Fellow at Southern Methodist University's Center for Presidential History. I earned my PhD in History from George Mason University in 2019.

My research sits at the intersection of women's history, fitness history, and history of the body. Additionally, my work often relies upon computational methodologies as a research tool for examining large corpuses of primary sources and gleaning new insights. My current book, _Shaping Up: Physical Fitness for Women 1880-1965_, examines why the fitness of female bodies was a matter of national concern and interest throughout the twentieth century. _Shaping Up_ traces the origins of how fitness became a tool in the repertoire of physical educators, reformers and state actors who sought to shape behavior and inscribe their values onto the female body, often in reaction to various social anxieties throughout the twentieth century. I argue that the fitness and shape of the female body became an issue of interest tailor-made for government intervention well before the modern fitness movement was born.

From 2013 to 2015 I was a Digital History Fellow at the [Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and New Media (RRCHNM).](https://rrchnm.org) Following my fellowship, I continued at RRCHNM where I served as the Software Development Manger for the [PressForward Project](http://www.pressforward.org) and as the Managing Editor of [Digital Humanities Now](http://www.digitalhumanitiesnow.org). I have also taught in the Department of History and Art History at GMU. Specifically, I taught the department's undergraduate digital history course which teaches students to do ask and answer historical questions using digital software.
