I am an Assistant Professor in the [Department of History and Geography](https://www.clemson.edu/caah/departments/history/) at Clemson University and serve as the Interim Associate Director of the [Digital History Ph.D. Program](https://digitalhistory.clemson.edu/). I specialize in digital history, with a focus on late-nineteenth and twentieth-century U.S. history and women's history.

Before joining Clemson, I was a Digital Humanities Postdoctoral Fellow at Southern Methodist University's [Center for Presidential History](https://www.smu.edu/cph). I completed my Ph.D. at George Mason University in 2019. From 2013 to 2015 I held a Digital History Fellowship at the [Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and New Media (RRCHNM)](https://rrchnm.org/), where I subsequently managed software development for the [PressForward Project](https://pressforward.org/) and was the managing editor of _[Digital Humanities Now](https://digitalhumanitiesnow.org/)_.

I'm currently under contract with the University of Virginia Press for my book manuscript, _Shaping Up: Physical Fitness for Women, 1880â€“1965_, which explores why women's fitness became a matter of national concern throughout the twentieth century.
