Welcome! I am an Assistant Professor in the [Department of History and Geography](https://www.clemson.edu/caah/departments/history/) at Clemson University. I specialize in digital history as well as late-nineteenth and twentieth-century U.S. history with a focus on women's history.

Previously, I was a Digital Humanities Postdoctoral Fellow at Southern Methodist University's [Center for Presidential History.](https://www.smu.edu/cph) I earned my Ph.D. from George Mason University in 2019. From 2013 to 2015 I was a Digital History Fellow at the [Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and New Media (RRCHNM)](https://rrchnm.org). Following my fellowship, I continued at RRCHNM where I served as the Software Development Manager for the [PressForward Project](https://pressforward.org) and as the Managing Editor of [Digital Humanities Now](https://digitalhumanitiesnow.org).

I am currently working on a book manuscript entitled, _Shaping Up: Physical Fitness for Women 1880-1965_, which examines why the fitness of female bodies was a matter of national concern and interest throughout the twentieth century. It is under contract with the University of Virginia Press.
