I am a historian of the late-nineteenth and early twentieth-centuries. Currently, I am a Digital Humanities Postdoctoral Fellow at Southern Methodist University's Center for Presidential History. I earned my PhD in History from George Mason University in 2019.

My research sits at the intersection of women's history, fitness history, and history of the body. Additionally, my work often relies upon computational methodologies as a research tool for examining large corpuses of primary sources and gleaning new insights. My current book is entitled [“Shaping Up: Physical Fitness Initiatives for Women, 1880-1965”](/shapingup) and examines particular instances in the twentieth-century when patriarchal forces sought to encourage the fitness of female bodies. I argue that the discourse of fitness became a powerful instrument in managing women's bodies around a series of conflicting social, economic, and political demands.

From 2013 to 2015 I was a Digital History Fellow at the [Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and New Media (RRCHNM).](https://rrchnm.org) Following my fellowship, I continued at RRCHNM as a Graduate Research Assistant and served as the Software Development Manger for the [PressForward Project](http://www.pressforward.org) and as the Managing Editor of [Digital Humanities Now](http://www.digitalhumanitiesnow.org). I have also taught in the Department of History and Art History at GMU. Specifically, I taught the department's undergraduate digital history course which teaches students to do ask and answer historical questions using digital software.
