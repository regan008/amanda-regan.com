I am a Ph.D. Candidate in the Department of History and Art History at George Mason University and a historian of the late-nineteenth and early twentieth-centuries. My research sits at the intersection of women's history, fitness history, and history of the body. Additionally, my work often relies upon computational methodologies as a research tool for examining large corpuses of primary sources and gleaning new insights.

My dissertation is entitled [“Shaping Up: Physical Fitness Initiatives for Women, 1880-1965”](/shapingup) and examines particular instances in the twentieth-century when patriarchal forces sought to encourage the fitness of female bodies. In the dissertation I argue that the discourse of fitness became a powerful instrument in managing women's bodies around a series of conflicting social, economic, and political demands.

From 2013 to 2015 I was a Digital History Fellow at the [Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and New Media (RRCHNM).](https://rrchnm.org) Following my fellowship, I continued at RRCHNM as a Graduate Research Assistant and served as the Software Development Manger for the [PressForward Project](http://www.pressforward.org) and as the Managing Editor of [Digital Humanities Now](http://www.digitalhumanitiesnow.org). Currently, I am a Graduate Lecturer in the Department of History and Art History at GMU where I teach the department's undergraduate digital history course.
