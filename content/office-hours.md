If you are a undergraduate or graduate student at Clemson University, you are welcome to make an appointment to come chat with me in my office hours. 

The links below will allow you to book an appointment. This app syncs with my calendar and will show you when I am available. If none of the slots work for you, please send me an email and we'll make other arrangements. You must make appointments no less that 2 hours in advance. Please email me if the issue is urgent. Once you complete the form, it will send you a calendar invite and I will confirm the appointment with you.  

Unless we've made other arrangements, all meetings are in person. My office is in Hardin Hall 004 (in the basement).
