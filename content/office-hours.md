If you’re an undergraduate or graduate student at Clemson, feel free to schedule a time to chat—whether you have course questions or want to discuss digital history projects. I’m always happy to connect about class topics, research ideas, or technical methods. Use the links below to propose a time; once you choose a slot, I’ll confirm or decline by email. Please treat your selected time as tentative until you hear back.

All meetings take place in person in my office at Hardin Hall 004 (basement) unless we’ve arranged to meet on Zoom, in which case the link will appear in your calendar invitation. I ask that you make appointments no less that 2 hours in advance. If the issue is urgent, please email me and we'll make other arrangements.
