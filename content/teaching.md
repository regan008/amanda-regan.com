## Courses

### History 390: The Digital Past, George Mason University
The Digital Past is an undergraduate history class at George Mason University which fulfills the University's IT Requirement. In this class students explore technologies such as maps, data sets, and visualizations within the context of an upper division history class. Students learn how to find and use digital information for research as well as how question, analyze, summarize, and interpret it. The class is centered around using digital tools to ask and answer historical questions but is also grounded in traditional historical pedagogy including rigorous reading and writing.

## Digital Humanities Workshops
In addition to teaching traditional history courses at the university level, I also often teach workshops on digital tools and methodologies. In the past I've led workshops on text analysis and computational thinking as well as on tools such as [Omeka](www.omeka.org), [Zotero](www.zotero.org), and [PressForward](www.pressforward.org).
