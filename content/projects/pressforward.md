PressForward is a free and open-source software project that enables teams of researchers to aggregate, filter, and disseminate relevant scholarship using the popular WordPress web publishing platform. First, as the Graduate Research Assistant, and later the Software Development Manager, I collaborated with team members to outline development priorities and milestone goals while also overseeing the testing and release processes. I also built the <a href=’https://pressforward.org/version-2-0-of-the-pressforward-turnkey-theme-released/’>PressForward TurnKey Theme</a> which allows publications to make PressForward statistics easily viewable by readers. In 2017 I undertook redesigning the PressFoward.org website.
