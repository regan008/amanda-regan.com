I'm all finished with my [image assignment](http://www.amanda-regan.com/ClioWired2/Portfolio/Image).  As I've been talking about for the last few weeks I used some images from a  scrapbook I scanned a few years ago.  The images were pretty damaged since they were glued into the scrapbook and were often yellowed and wrinkled.  This created quite the challenge for restoration but I think they turned out pretty good or at least far better than they were.  I look forward to comments from the class!
