### Course Description
Welcome to History 8500, Methods in Digital History I. This course in computational history will teach you to create, manipulate, explore, and visualize historical data with the goal of advancing historical arguments.

This class is the first in a series of two digital history methods courses at Clemson University. This course will break down into roughly four units. 

This course will proceed in roughly 3 units. In the first students will learn to navigate their computer using the command line, learn file system structure and basic server architecture, and will learn how to use GitHub to ensure reproducible datasets and code. Students will also be introduced to static websites and will begin a semester long project of building a personal website and portfolio in the static website software Hugo. The next unit focuses on the basics of the programming with an emphasis on computational thinking skills and the foundational patterns behind every programming language. Finally, in the last half of our course, we will survey various methods within computational history and ask ourselves, what kinds of historical questions do these methods make possible? Each week will focus on a new method -- visualization, mapping, and several forms of text analysis. By the end of this course you'll have gained a basic familiarity and competency all of these approaches, but **more importantly** you'll understand how to ask and answer historical questions using the computational methods that are useful to you. While not required, it is best to take this course alongside History 8550: Theories of Digital Analysis which has been designed to compliment the topics in this class and provide a theoretical and scholarly underpinning for the methods we learn in class. 

#### Why R?
There are numerous languages we could learn in this course but we'll focus on R which is common in the field of digital history as well as data science. With roots in statistical analysis, R is a high level programming language (meaning further from machine code or really complicated languages like C++). However, more important than the specific language are the programming fundamentals you will learn. After this class you may decide that Python, PHP, Go, or any other number of programming languages better suits your needs based on the historical questions you want to ask. Learning these fundamentals will allow you to pivot as needed and learn new languages, syntaxes, and tools.

#### A Note on Data and Sources for this Class
For the most part, I've provided datasets for all of the assignments in this class so that you don't have to worry about learning the material *and* creating a historical dataset that will work with that approach. The only exception to this is the assignment on dataset creation but I will provided suggested primary source repositories in case you don't yet have a set of sources in mind. However, you are welcome (and encouraged) to use your own data for any assignment. Doing so will only further prepare you for your future classes in digital history and for your dissertation.

### Learning goals:
**At the conclusion of this course you will:**
* understand the basic computational patterns in programming.
* Be able to use documentation for programming languages and libraries to learn skills as they become applicable to your work.
* Be able to create historical data from primary sources.
* Understand how to clean, organize, manipulate, and document that data.
* Critically evaluate existing historical data.
* be familiar with the major computational methodologies (i.e. mapping, text analysis etc) and what types of historical data and questions those methods are useful for. Understand their limitations and strengths.
* Create basic static visualizations to communicate your work and methods to other historians.


### Required Texts: 
* **A note about texts for this course:** There is no need to purchase texts for this course as they are all freely available online or available through the Clemson Library. However, if you prefer hard copies or would like a reference guide, I highly recommend purchasing a copy of Hadley Whickham's _R for Data Science_ which is an invaluable reference guide. 
* Texts:
    * Whickham, Hadely _R for Data Science_, 2nd edition, Ingram Publishers, 2023. [Open Access Edition](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/)

* **Worksheets and Other Weekly Coding Assignments (40%):** Most weeks you will complete a worksheet that is based on the method for the week. With a few exceptions, these worksheets will be due the week after we discuss that method. Worksheets will be Quatro documents that allow you to blend code and prose and in these worksheets you'll be asked to practice various concepts with a provided dataset. These worksheets will contain a mix of problems ranging from easy to very hard. There is not an answer key that I'll grade from and many questions will have multiple ways to answer the question. The goal here is to *practice the methodology at hand.* It's one thing to read about the methodology and read the documentation for the associated R packages, but it's another thing to actually apply that methodology to historical sources and ask questions of it. So, in other words, the goal of these worksheets is twofold. First, it is to grasp the basic programming concepts related to the methodology. Second, it is to understand what types of historical questions can be asked of that method and what kinds of arguments or interpretations it makes possible. There are a total of seven worksheets across the semester. 
	* Worksheets are listed in the schedule on the day they are due. Note that in all cases they are due **before the start of class**. 
		* #1: R Basics
		* #2: Data Structures
		* #3: Data Manipulation
		* #4: Data Visualization
		* #5: Mapping
		* #6: Text Analysis
		* #7: Topic Modeling
* **Portfolio and Digital Presence (15%):**
* **Tech Table Participation, Failure Journal & Weekly Responses (20%):**
  * Each week our wedensday class will be a "Tech Table." This is a student driven class session where we will troubleshoot concepts from the week's topic and worksheet or assignment. For each tech table students will need to have made a reasonable start on the assignment for the week and will come to class ready to discuss potential issues or errors. Students must submit questions about the course material to the Slack channel by 10am on the day of the tech table. The Failure Journal, a log and reflection of your work for this class as well as notes on troubleshooting resources, strategies, and attempts is due each Monday prior to class. 
  * A note on AI: The world of coding is at a turning point and AI tools have changed the landscape significantly. Students will be introduced to AI tools halfway through the semester. However, it is crucial that in the first half of the semester our focus be on learning the logic and underlying processes behind programming concepts. You must learn to think computationally before you can make the most of AI programming tools. Therefore, any use of AI in the first half of the semester will result in an automatic failure on the assignment and I will report you to the graduate school for academic dishonesty. **Students may not use AI until expressly given permission by the professor.** When students do being using AI programming tools, they must log their use and reflect on it in their failure journals.
* **Dataset and Method Proposal	(25%):** At the conclusion of the semester each of you will write a dataset and method proposal for a digital history project. Further details will be provided in class but students should think about the process of creating a dataset and the decisions that are invovled in building one. This assignment will ask you to take a body of historical sources and think about how it might be turned into a dataset that you would then use a digital method analyze it. Students should address questions like: What historical question are you asking? What is the dataset based on? What information will be captured and how will it be stored? Will you be importing external data? (i.e. Historical place names from an existing dataset or information about a person's term in office.) If so, where will that information come from? Who owns it? What are the methods behind the data collection design and process? What method will be used to analyze it and how will the dataset be transformed to fit that method? Why is this method the appropriate choice to ask and answer your historical question?

### Policies & Procedures

_Please note that this syllabus may be updated online as necessary. The online version of this syllabus is the only authoritative version._

##### Late Work
Due dates for all assignments are listed on the course syllabus and in the schedule for the class. Because of the technical nature of this class it is **essential** that you keep up with the worksheets. If you miss one worksheet the others will be much harder because you will have missed key concepts. Unless otherwise stated, assignments are due on the day listed on the syllabus and canvas. If you submit an assignment late, I will deduct 10% for every day that it is late. Assignments submitted more than 7 days after the due date will not be accepted. 

##### Classroom Conduct

In order to learn, we must be open to the views of people different from ourselves. In the time we share together over the semester, please honor the uniqueness of your fellow classmates and appreciate the opportunity we have to learn from one another. Please respect each others’ opinions and refrain from personal attacks or demeaning comments of any kind. Anyone who engages in hostile or antagonistic rhetoric will be asked to leave the classroom immediately.

##### Academic Integrity
As members of the Clemson University community, we have inherited Thomas Green Clemson's vision of this institution as a "high seminary of learning." Fundamental to this vision is a mutual commitment to truthfulness, honor, and responsibility, without which we cannot earn the trust and respect of others. Furthermore, we recognize that academic dishonesty detracts from the value of a Clemson degree. Therefore, we shall not tolerate lying, cheating, or stealing in any form.

All infractions of academic dishonesty by undergraduates must be reported to Undergraduate Studies for resolution through that office. In cases of plagiarism instructors may use the Plagiarism Resolution Form.

See the [Undergraduate Academic Integrity Policy](https://www.clemson.edu/academics/integrity/) website for additional information and the [current catalogue](https://catalog.clemson.edu/index.php?catoid=33) for the policy.

Please keep in mind that if you are copying and pasting text that you did not write yourself, you might be plagiarizing. If you are using copied text, whether pasted or retyped manually, you must be sure to accurately cite the information. Text is accurately cited when: 1) pasted text is surrounded by quotation marks or offset as a block quote and 2) the pasted text is attributed to its author and source and 3) the pasted text is cited in a footnote, endnote, or bibliography.

##### Student Accessibility Services
Clemson University values the diversity of our student body as a strength and a critical component of our dynamic community. Students with disabilities or temporary injuries/conditions may require accommodations due to barriers in the structure of facilities, course design, technology used for curricular purposes, or other campus resources. Students who experience a barrier to full access to this class should let the instructor know and make an appointment to meet with a staff member in Student Accessibility Services as soon as possible. You can make an appointment by calling 864-656-6848, by emailing [studentaccess@lists.clemson.edu]( mailto:studentaccess@lists.clemson.edu), or by visiting Suite 239 in the Academic Success Center building. Appointments are strongly encouraged – drop-ins will be seen if at all possible, but there could be a significant wait due to scheduled appointments.  Students who have accommodations are strongly encouraged to request, obtain and send these to their instructors through their AIM portal as early in the semester as possible so that accommodations can be made in a timely manner. It is the student’s responsibility to follow this process each semester.  
You can access further information at the [Student Accessibility website](https://www.clemson.edu/academics/studentaccess/index.html).  Other information is at the university’s [Accessibility Portal.](https://www.clemson.edu/accessibility/access/accommodations-services.html)

##### Commitment to Diversity
"Clemson University aspires to create a diverse community that welcomes people of different  races, cultures, ages, genders, sexual orientation, religions, socioeconomic levels, political perspectives, abilities, opinions, values and experiences." - The Clemson University Title IX statement regarding non-discrimination

Clemson University is committed to a policy of equal opportunity for all persons and does not discriminate on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender, pregnancy, national origin, age, disability, veteran’s status, genetic information or protected activity in employment, educational programs and activities, admissions and financial aid. This includes a prohibition against sexual harassment and sexual violence as mandated by Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972. This [Title IX policy](http://www.clemson.edu/campus-life/campus-services/access/title-ix/) is located on the Campus Life website. Ms. Alesia Smith is the Clemson University Title IX Coordinator, and the Executive Director of Equity Compliance. Her office is located at 223 Brackett Hall, 864.656.0620. Remember, email is not a fully secured method of communication and should not be used to discuss Title IX issues.

##### Emergency Preparedness
Emergency procedures have been posted in all buildings and on all elevators. Students should be reminded to review these procedures for their own safety. All students and employees should be familiar with guidelines from the Clemson Police Department. Visit here for information about safety.

Clemson University is committed to providing a safe campus environment for students, faculty, staff, and visitors. As members of the community, we encourage you to take the following actions to be better prepared in case of an emergency:
* Ensure you are signed up for emergency alerts  
* Download the Rave Guardian app to your phone (https://www.clemson.edu/cusafety/cupd/rave-guardian/)
* Learn what you can do to prepare yourself in the event of an active threat (http://www.clemson.edu/cusafety/EmergencyManagement/)
