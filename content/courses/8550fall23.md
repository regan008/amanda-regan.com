### Course Overview

In History 8550, you will build a digital history project and paper that is based on original research in primary sources and is situated in the appropriate historiographical context. The final product should be a seminar style paper that forefronts digital history methods and is between 7,500 and 10,000 words, plus notes, code and other appendicies as necessary. You will work in collaboration with the course instructor and your advisor to come up with a project that uses digital methods to advance a historiographical interpretation. Unlike a traditional seminar paper, this paper will likely have multiple components (a dataset, narrative writing piece, and code).

The format of this final project may differ depending on the methods and sources that you use for your project. While not required, many student will build on projects, code, or ideas developed in History 8510. Regardless of the platform you choose to work in, all students will create a documented dataset based on primary source research and use digital methods to analyze it. 

##### Learning Objectives:

##### Required Texts:
* Zachary Schrag, [_The Princeton Guide to Historical Research_](https://www.amazon.com/Princeton-Historical-Research-Skills-Scholars/dp/0691198225/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1681058903&sr=8-1)
* Betty Lai, [_The Grant Writing Guide: A Roadmap for Scholars_](https://www.amazon.com/Grant-Writing-Guide-Scholars-Skills/dp/0691231885/ref=sr_1_1?crid=XOB7POCZT26W&keywords=grant+proposal+princeton&qid=1681058961&sprefix=grant+proposal+princeton%2Caps%2C108&sr=8-1)
* Gerald Graff and Cathy Birkenstein, [_They Say, I Say: The Moves that Matter in Academic Writing_](https://www.amazon.com/They-Say-I/dp/0393538702/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1Y5XCQS5861BS&keywords=they+say+I+say&qid=1681059008&sprefix=they+say+i+say%2Caps%2C106&sr=8-1)

* **Research Proposal/Grant Application:** TBA
* **Digital History Project and Paper:** The format and platform for your project may differ depending on your topic so many of the details for this assignment will be worked out on an indivudal basis between the student and instructor. But in general there will be several components to this project: 
    * **Dataset** - every student will have some form of a dataset. Every dataset must have a written discussion of methodology in the format of a data biography. In most cases the data should be hosted in its own repository on github. 
    * **Code** - Many projects will have code that accompanies the project. Whether for data manipulation purposes (something like geocoding or ocr), or for data analysis (text analysis, mapping etc) a github repository for the project should be created and code should be commented with descriptive transparent commentary about the methods being used. Code should be reproducible and open access unless there are ethical or copyright concerns. 
    * **Written Component** - Every student must write a seminar style paper based on their work. In some cases data and code will be integrated into the article itself in the style of articles from the _Journal of Digital Histroy_. Others, such as those working in GIS or with an extensive relational database, may need to include screenshots or links to their paper. The format will be worked out in consultation with the instructor on an individual basis, but in general the written component should be between 8,000 and 10,000 words. 
* **Class Participation, Peer Reviews, and other written work:** Throughout the class you will have small chunks of writing, drafts, and peer reviews due. These milestones are outlined in the schedule and all assignments should be posted to canvas and to slack where noted in the schedule. 


##### Grading System
Final grades will follow Clemson's percentage-based grading scale. Please note that I will round up _only_ if you fall within .5% of the next grade up. So, for example, I will round up a grade that is a 89.51% or higher. Please do not ask me to round your grade up if you don't fall within that range.

* A: 90-100%
* B: 80-90%
* C: 70-79%
* D: 60-69%
* F: 0-59%
