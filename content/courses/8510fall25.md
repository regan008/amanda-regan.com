### Course Overview
History 8510: Methods in Digital History II is the second course in a sequence of digital methods courses for Digital History PhD students at Clemson University. While the first class focused on building foundational computational thinking skills and familiarity with the principles of turning primary sources into historical datasets for computational analysis, this class tackles a number of advanced topics and methods. Students will learn to create relational databases, implement OCR and AI-powered transcription workflows, apply computer vision and advanced text analysis techniques, and develop interactive web applications that serve as research tools for historical inquiry.

This course moves beyond R to demonstrate how computational thinking principles translate across programming languages. While some assignments will continue using R, students will also learn to apply the same core analytical concepts to other languages like Python and SQL. The syntax may change, but the fundamental computational thinking patterns remain consistent. Students will be aided by tools like GitHub CoPilot for coding syntax and troubleshooting when necessary, allowing them to focus on methodological understanding rather than getting stuck on technical syntax barriers.

Students will complete four mini assignments that apply these advanced methods to primary sources related to their research. For each assignment, they will conduct computational analysis and then write a 2-4 page paper discussing the method and its application to specific historical questions. The course continues to emphasize the core belief that history drives the digital, not the other way around. Through this approach, students develop both technical proficiency and critical evaluation skills necessary for integrating computational methods with traditional historical inquiry. Students will leave the class prepared for original research that leverages these advanced techniques to answer complex historical questions.

#### Learning Objectives
1. Develop technical skills for advanced digital scholarship. Students will create relational databases, build processing pipelines, develop interactive web applications using Shiny, and maintain reproducible research practices through version control, preparing them for original research and dissertation work that leverages computational approaches.
2. Evaluate and implement advanced digital methods. Students will critically assess and apply specialized techniques including database design, OCR/AI transcription, computer vision, named entity recognition, text reuse detection, topic modeling, and vector alignment to address specific historical research questions.
3. Apply computational thinking principles across multiple programming environments. Students will demonstrate the ability to transfer core analytical concepts from R to other programming languages including Python and SQL, understanding that while syntax varies, fundamental computational logic remains consistent across platforms.
4. Practice reproducible research and effective documentation. Students will create clear documentation of their computational processes, maintain reproducible workflows through GitHub, and effectively present their methodological choices and findings to scholarly audiences.
5. Navigate AI technologies and their appropriate applications. Students will understand the broad spectrum of "artificial intelligence" technologies beyond large language models, evaluate when and where these methods might be appropriate for historical research, and maintain responsible AI usage policies that limit AI assistance to coding support while preserving scholarly integrity. See the courses AI policy for more information about AI for coding support.

### Assignments & Grades
* **Database Project & Analysis (20%):** Create a relational database for your historical research project using SQLite with a minimum of 30 entries, at least one junction/lookup table, and demonstrate its utility by writing at least one query that addresses a specific historical question relevant to your research. Write a 2-4 page paper documenting your database structure, explaining the historical context and research questions that informed your design, and analyzing the results of your queries. Create a GitHub repository with clear documentation and code. 
* **OCR + AI Transcription Project & Analysis (20%):** Using 5-10 pages of historical sources related to your research, create processing pipelines using both Tesseract OCR and AI-powered transcription services. In a 2-4 page analysis, compare and contrast these methods' effectiveness with your specific source materials, discuss limitations unique to your documents, and propose strategies for improving transcription quality. You must obtain approval for your sources and AI prompts before beginning, document all code in a GitHub repository, and test at least two different AI models. 
* **Computer Vision or Advanced Text Analysis Project & Analysis (20%):** Select either computer vision or one advanced text analysis method (NER, text reuse detection, topic modeling, or vector alignment) and apply it to your historical sources. Write a 2-4 page analysis discussing your chosen method, the historical questions you investigated, your findings, and a critical assessment of this approach's effectiveness for your research area. You must propose your method choice for approval and maintain appropriate dataset sizes for meaningful analysis. 
* **Visualization Project & Analysis (20%):** Design and build either a Shiny (R) or Flask with Plotly (Python) web application that serves as a research tool for historical inquiry, whether visualizing analytical results, providing database interfaces, or offering other research functionality. Deploy your application online and write a 2-4 page paper introducing your visualization, explaining its research applications, demonstrating how it advances historical understanding through digital methods, and justifying your choice of framework (Shiny vs. Flask) based on your project goals and technical considerations. You must discuss your concept for approval before development and include user documentation. This capstone integrates technical skills with historical argumentation.
* **Participation and Failure Journal (10%):** Participation includes regular class attendance, active engagement in classroom activities, thoughtful interaction with course readings and materials, and timely completion of weekly coding assignments and exercises. Each Wednesday "Tech Table" session is student-driven troubleshooting focused on the week's concepts and assignments. Students must make reasonable progress on weekly assignments before attending and submit questions about course material to the Slack channel by 10am on Tech Table days. The Failure Journal, due each Monday before class unless otherwise noted, serves as a log of your weekly work and a reflection on your learning process, documenting troubleshooting resources, strategies attempted, errors encountered, and solutions discovered.
* **Digital Methods Reflection (10%):** Write a reflective essay examining your development across the digital history methods sequence (Methods I, Methods II, and any additional DH courses). Define your current research interests and evaluate which digital approaches prove most effective and relevant for your scholarly goals. Assess your technical skills, methodological preferences, and areas of expertise as you prepare for original research in the digital history seminar. This reflection should demonstrate critical thinking about the relationship between digital tools and historical inquiry while articulating your emerging identity as a digital historian.

### Course Policies

#### Attendance and Absence Policy
Regular attendance and active participation are essential components of this class. Students are expected to attend all class sessions and engage meaningfully in discussions, activities, and collaborative work. Given the workshop-style nature of many class meetings and the importance of collaborative troubleshooting in the digital history process, your presence contributes not only to your own learning but to the success of your classmates’ projects as well.

If you must miss a class due to illness or other unavoidable circumstances, please notify the professor as soon as possible and make arrangements to catch up on any missed content or assignments. Frequent absences will negatively impact your participation grade and may hinder your ability to complete the course successfully.

#### Late Work Policy
Due to the technical nature of this course and the importance of maintaining consistent engagement with computational methods, it is essential that students keep up with the pace of coursework outlined in the schedule. Each assignment is designed to be reviewed and troubleshot during Tech Table sessions, where students can ask questions and work through technical challenges with peers and the instructor. Students who fall behind on assignments will miss these crucial opportunities to troubleshoot and develop fluency with each method. Given the pace of the course and the introduction of new methods each week, missing these collaborative problem-solving sessions can significantly hinder a student's ability to master the technical skills necessary for advanced digital history work.

All assignments are due on the dates specified in the syllabus. Late submissions will result in a 10% grade deduction for each day the assignment is overdue. Assignments more than 7 days late will not be accepted. Given the scaffolded nature of this course, where each component builds upon the previous one, students must start early and work efficiently throughout the semester. Extensions may be granted only in exceptional circumstances and must be requested well in advance of the due date.

#### AI Use Policy
This course teaches advanced digital history methods involving R, Python, and other programming languages. You are encouraged to use AI tools (ChatGPT, Claude, Copilot, etc.) as coding assistants and learning coaches to help you debug code, troubleshoot errors, learn syntax and programming concepts, understand functions and methods, get assistance with code structure and optimization, and interpret error messages. However, you must maintain rigorous standards for their use and remember that you are the historian with domain expertise.

When using AI for coding assistance, you must understand every line of AI-generated code before submitting it, test and verify all AI-suggested solutions, and remain responsible for checking AI work for accuracy and appropriateness to your specific historical research context. You must stay the “historian in the loop,” making informed decisions about your research and code rather than blindly accepting AI suggestions. Use AI as a tool to enhance your learning and productivity, not as a crutch that prevents you from developing essential programming skills.

AI use is strictly prohibited for things like data analysis, interpretation of results, writing papers, reflections, or any written assignments, generating historical arguments or conclusions, or completing assignments without genuinely understanding the underlying processes and concepts. Any use of AI for analysis or written work will result in immediate failure of that assignment and potentially the class. Remember that per the Graduate Handbook’s minimum grade policy and the Graduate School’s probation policies, failing this course (defined as less than a C) may result in academic probation. It may also lead to the termination of your assistantship or dismissal from the program. You are the historian with specialized knowledge and critical thinking skills that cannot and should not be outsourced to AI systems.
