PressForward is a free and open-source software project that enables teams of researchers to aggregate, filter, and disseminate relevant scholarship using the popular WordPress web publishing platform. From 2014-2016 I was the Graduate Research Assistant for PressForward and I assisted with software development, testing, and outreach. From 2017 - 2018 I was the Software Development Manager for the project and I oversaw a team of graduate students and helped to set development priorities and testing schedules for the project. In this role, I was also responsible for the design and development of PressForward.org as well as teaching a number of workshops on how to use PressForward.
